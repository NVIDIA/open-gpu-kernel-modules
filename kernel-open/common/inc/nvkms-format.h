/*
 * In order to interpret these pixel format namings, please take note of these
 * conventions:
 * - The Y8_U8__Y8_V8_N422 and U8_Y8__V8_Y8_N422 formats are both packed formats
 *   that have an interleaved chroma component across every two pixels. The
 *   double-underscore is a separator between these two pixel groups.
 * - The triple-underscore is a separator between planes.
 * - The 'N' suffix is a delimiter for the chroma decimation factor.
 *
 * As examples of the above rules:
 * - The Y8_U8__Y8_V8_N422 format has one 8-bit luma component (Y8) and one
 *   8-bit chroma component (U8) in pixel N, and one 8-bit luma component (Y8)
 *   and one 8-bit chroma component (V8) in pixel (N + 1). This format is
 *   422-decimated since the U and V chroma samples are shared between each
 *   pair of adjacent pixels per line.
 * - The Y10___U10V10_N444 format has one plane of 10-bit luma (Y10) components,
 *   and another plane of 10-bit chroma components (U10V10). This format has no
 *   chroma decimation since the luma and chroma components are sampled at the
 *   same rate.
