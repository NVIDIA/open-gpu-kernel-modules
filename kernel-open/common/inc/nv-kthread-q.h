// nv_kthread_q:
//
// 1. API and overview
//
//    This "nv_kthread_q" system implements a simple queuing system for deferred
//    work. The nv_kthread_q system has goals and use cases that are similar to
//    the named workqueues in the Linux kernel, but nv_kthread_q is much (10x or
//    so) smaller, simpler--and correspondingly less general. Deferred work
//    items are put into a queue, and run within the context of a dedicated set
//    of kernel threads (kthread).
//
//    In order to avoid confusion with the Linux workqueue system, I have
//    avoided using the term "work", and instead refer to "queues" (also called
//    "q's") and "queue items" (also called "q_items"), in both variable names
//    and comments.
//
//    This module depends only upon the Linux kernel.
//
//    Queue items that are submitted to separate nv_kthread_q instances are
//    guaranteed to be run in different kthreads.
//
//    Queue items that are submitted to the same nv_kthread_q are not guaranteed
//    to be serialized, nor are they guaranteed to run concurrently.
//
// 2. Allocations
//
//    The caller allocates queues and queue items. The nv_kthread_q APIs do
//    the initialization (zeroing and setup) of queues and queue items.
//    Allocation is handled that way, because one of the first use cases is a
//    bottom half interrupt handler, and for that, queue items should be
//    pre-allocated (for example, one per GPU), so that no allocation is
//    required in the top-half interrupt handler. Relevant API calls:
//
// 3. Queue initialization
//
//    nv_kthread_q_init() initializes a queue on the current NUMA node.
//
//    or
//
//    nv_kthread_q_init_on_node() initializes a queue on a specific NUMA node.
//
// 3. Scheduling things for the queue to run
//
//    The nv_kthread_q_schedule_q_item() routine will schedule a q_item to run.
//
// 4. Stopping the queue(s)
//
//    The nv_kthread_q_stop() routine will flush the queue, and safely stop
//    the kthread, before returning.
//

// The queue must not be used before calling this routine.
//
// The caller allocates an nv_kthread_q_t item. This routine initializes
// the queue, and starts up a kernel thread ("kthread") to service the queue.
// The queue will initially be empty; there is intentionally no way to
// pre-initialize the queue with items to run.
//
// In order to avoid external dependencies (specifically, NV_STATUS codes), this
// returns a Linux kernel (negative) errno on failure, and zero on success. It
// is safe to call nv_kthread_q_stop() on a queue that nv_kthread_q_init()
// failed for.
//
// A short prefix of the qname arg will show up in []'s, via the ps(1) utility.
//
// The kernel thread stack is preferably allocated on the specified NUMA node, 
// but fallback to another node is possible because kernel allocators do not
// guarantee affinity. Note that NUMA-affinity applies only to
// the kthread stack. This API does not do anything about limiting the CPU
// affinity of the kthread. That is left to the caller.
//
// Reusing a queue: once a queue is initialized, it must be safely shut down
// (see "Stopping the queue(s)", below), before it can be reused. So, for
// a simple queue use case, the following will work:
//
//     nv_kthread_q_init_on_node(&some_q, "display_name", preferred_node);
//     nv_kthread_q_stop(&some_q);
//     nv_kthread_q_init_on_node(&some_q, "reincarnated", preferred_node);

// The caller is responsible for stopping all queues, by calling this routine
// before, for example, kernel module unloading. This nv_kthread_q_stop()
// routine will flush the queue, and safely stop the kthread, before returning.
//
// You may ONLY call nv_kthread_q_stop() once, unless you reinitialize the
// queue in between, as shown in the nv_kthread_q_init() documentation, above.
//
// Do not add any more items to the queue after calling nv_kthread_q_stop.

//
// This actually flushes the queue twice. That ensures that the queue is fully
// flushed, for an important use case: rescheduling from within one's own
// callback. In order to do that safely, you need to:
//
//     -- set a flag that tells the callback to stop rescheduling itself.
//
//     -- call either nv_kthread_q_flush or nv_kthread_q_stop (which internally
//        calls nv_kthread_q_flush). The nv_kthread_q_flush, in turn, actually
//        flushes the queue *twice*. The first flush waits for any callbacks
//        to finish, that missed seeing the "stop_rescheduling" flag. The
//        second flush waits for callbacks that were already scheduled when the
//        first flush finished.

// law of q-dynamics, it neither creates nor destroys q_items.
//
// When the callback (the function_to_run argument) is actually run, it is OK
// to free the q_item from within that routine. The nv_kthread_q system
// promises to be done with the q_item before that point.

// called from interrupt context, including top-half ISRs.
//
// It is OK to reschedule the same q_item from within its own callback function.
