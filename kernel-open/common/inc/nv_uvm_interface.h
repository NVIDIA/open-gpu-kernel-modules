    On devices that do not support HW TSGs on the requested engine, this API is

    nvUvmInterfaceChannelAllocate(), due to information stored in it necessary
    for channel allocation. However, when HW TSGs aren't supported, a TSG handle

    nvUvmInterfacePagingChannelPushStream

    Used for remote execution of the passed methods; the UVM driver uses this
    interface to ask the vGPU plugin to execute certain HW methods on its
    behalf. The callee should push the methods in the specified order i.e. is
    not allowed to do any reordering.

    The API is asynchronous. The UVM driver can wait on the remote execution by
    inserting a semaphore release method at the end of the method stream, and
    then loop until the semaphore value reaches the completion value indicated
    in the release method.

    The valid HW methods that can be passed by the UVM driver follow; the source
    functions listed contain the exact formatting (encoding) of the HW method
    used by the UVM driver for Ampere.

        the possibility of invalidating everything).
        See uvm_hal_pascal_host_tlb_invalidate_all.

      - Replayable fault replay. See uvm_hal_volta_replay_faults.

      - Replayable fault cancellation targeting a guest virtual address. See

      - Membar, scoped to device or to the entire system. See
        uvm_hal_pascal_host_membar_gpu and uvm_hal_pascal_host_membar_sys

      - Host semaphore acquire, see uvm_hal_turing_host_semaphore_acquire. The
        virtual address specified in the semaphore operation must lie within a
        buffer previously mapped by nvUvmInterfacePagingChannelsMap.

      - CE semaphore release, see uvm_hal_pascal_ce_semaphore_release. The
        virtual address specified in the semaphore operation must lie within a
        buffer previously mapped by nvUvmInterfacePagingChannelsMap.

      - 64 bits-wide memset, see uvm_hal_kepler_ce_memset_8. The destination
        address is a physical address in vidmem.

        of a memcopy method within the input stream itself.

      - Memcopy, see uvm_hal_kepler_ce_memcopy. The destination address is a
        physical address in vidmem. The source address is an offset within
        methodStream, in bytes, indicating the location of the (inlined) source
        buffer. The copy size does not exceed 4KB.

      - CE semaphore release with timestamp, see

    NOTES:
      - This function uses a pre-allocated stack per paging channel
        (stored in the UvmGpuPagingChannel object)
      - This function DOES NOT acquire the RM API or GPU locks. That is because
        it is called during fault servicing, which could produce deadlocks.
      - Concurrent calls to this function using channels under same device are not
        allowed due to:
          a. pre-allocated stack
          b. the fact that internal RPC infrastructure doesn't acquire GPU lock.
        Therefore, locking is the caller's responsibility.

    Arguments:

        methodStream[IN]     - HW methods to be pushed to the paging channel.

        methodStreamSize[IN] - Size of methodStream, in bytes. The maximum push
                               size is 128KB.
