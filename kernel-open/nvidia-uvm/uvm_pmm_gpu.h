//
// The Physical Memory Manager (PMM) manages the life cycle of GPU physical
// memory.
//
// The memory is managed in GPU chunks of different sizes (uvm_chunk_size_t) and
// users of PMM need to explicitly register the chunk sizes they need to be
// supported (see chunk_size_init_func in uvm_pmm_gpu_init()).
//
// Two memory types (uvm_pmm_gpu_memory_type_t) are supported, one for user and
// one for kernel allocations. The user memory type is used only for backing
// user data managed by VA blocks and kernel memory type is used for everything
// else. The distinction exists to support oversubscription, which requires the
// ability to evict already allocated memory from its users on-demand to satisfy
// new memory allocations when no more unused memory is available. Eviction is
// limited to the user memory type as it's a very complex operation requiring
// integration between PMM and other UVM driver modules. The assumption is that
// the vast majority of memory should be used for user data as everything else
// can be considered overhead and should be minimized. Two flavors of
// oversubscription exist: internal oversubscription allowing PMM allocations to
// evict other PMM allocations and external oversubscription allowing other PMA
// clients to evict memory used by PMM.
//
// Both allocation and freeing of memory support asynchronous operations where
// the allocated/freed GPU memory chunks can have pending GPU operations
// returned when allocating memory and passed in when freeing it via trackers.
