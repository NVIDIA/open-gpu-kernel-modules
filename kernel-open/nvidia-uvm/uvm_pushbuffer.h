// UVM pushbuffer
//
// The UVM pushbuffer is a memory allocator specialized for managing allocations
// used as the backing store for methods sent to the GPU (pushes, abstracted by
// uvm_push_t). Each pushbuffer is usable only with a specific channel manager
// and hence a specific GPU as that allows for greater flexibility down the road
// (e.g. moving the pushbuffer allocation to GPU memory in some cases).
//
// The usage of the pushbuffer always follows the same pattern:
//  1) The CPU requests a new allocation to do a push in. The allocation is
//     always initially of UVM_MAX_PUSH_SIZE and its usage is tracked by the
//     UVM push abstraction (uvm_push_t).
//  2) The CPU writes some GPU methods
//  3) The CPU finishes and reports how much of the UVM_MAX_PUSH_SIZE space was used
//  4) The methods are queued to be read by the GPU (by referencing them in a GPFIFO entry)
//  5) At some later time the CPU notices the methods have been completed and
//     reports that the allocation can now be reused.
//
// Notably 1) could happen concurrently from multiple CPU threads and in 4) the
// GPU has multiple independent queues of execution (UVM channels).
//
// With the above in mind, we can go through the implementation details of the
// current solution.
// The pushbuffer backing store is a single big allocation logically divided
// into largely independent parts called chunks.
// Each chunk is roughly a ringbuffer tracking multiple pending pushes being
// processed by the GPU. The pushbuffer maintains two bitmaps, one tracking
// completely idle (with no pending pushes) chunks and a second one tracking
// available (with pending pushes, but still enough space for a new push)
// chunks. When a new allocation is requested, idle chunks are always used
// first and after that available chunks are consulted. If none are available,
// the CPU spin waits on the GPU to complete some of the pending pushes making
// space for a new one.
//
// To explain how chunks track pending pushes we will go through an example
// modifying a chunk's state. Let's start with a few pending pushes in the
// chunk:
//
// [   [push P1][push P2][free unusable space][push P3][push P4]        ]
//     ^ gpu_get                                               ^ cpu_put
//
// The beginning of the first pending push is called the GPU get and the end of the
// last push is called the CPU put. This follows the HW GPFIFO naming that's a true
// ringbuffer (always completing in order and supporting transparent
// wrap-around). All the memory between gpu_get and cpu_put is considered
// unusable. Pushes within a chunk can finish out of order as each chunk can
// service pushes from multiple channels. And hence there can be some space
// between the first and last push that's already free, but unusable. The space
// after cpu_put and before gpu_get is available to be allocated to a new push,
// and if that happens the chunk above could change to:
//
// [   [push P1][push P2][free unusable space][push P3][push P4][push P5]       ]
//     ^ gpu_get                                                        ^ cpu_put
//
// Then, say push P2 completes:
//
// [   [push P1][free unusable space         ][push P3][push P4][push P5]       ]
//     ^ gpu_get                                                        ^ cpu_put
//
// We can see that P2 completing only expands the unusable free space, but if P1
// finishes we get:
//
// [                                          [push P3][push P4][push P5]       ]
//                                            ^ gpu_get                 ^ cpu_put
//
// This shows that some cases cause waste, but on the other hand allow for
// tracking of pending pushes and free space to be trivial. Each pending push of
// a chunk is in a doubly linked list with its head in the chunk. Each new push
// is added at the tail and when a push completes it's removed from the list.
// The gpu_get and/or cpu_put only change when the last/first push in the
// list finishes or a new push is added. The pending pushes are represented by
// the software state tracking GPFIFO entries (uvm_gpfifo_entry_t in
// uvm_channel.h) that are all allocated at channel creation (a HW channel has
// a fixed limit of GPFIFO entries it supports that's chosen at channel creation
// and we allocate all the SW state for them at channel creation as well). This
// allows all the operations of the pushbuffer to be free of any memory
// allocation.
//
// To illustrate that a chunk is only roughly a ringbuffer, let's see what
// happens when another push is added to the chunk above, but there is not
// enough space between cpu_put and the end of the chunk to fit UVM_MAX_PUSH_SIZE:
// [[push P6][free space                     ][push P3][push P4][push P5]       ]
//          ^ cpu_put                         ^ gpu_get
//
// The GPU reading the pushbuffer expects it to be in a consecutive VA and hence
// the pending pushes cannot wrap around in the chunk leading to some potential
// waste at the end.
//
// The pushbuffer implementation is configurable through a few defines below,
// but careful tweaking of them is yet to be done.
//

// TODO: Bug 1764958: Calculate/measure the maximum push size and tweak the
// number of chunks and size of each after benchmarks.
//
// Below are the measurements borrowed from uvm_channel_mgmt.h. They will need
// to be adjusted and verified once all the operations are implemented in this
// driver, but for now we will set the MAX_PUSH to 128K as that seems pretty
// safe.
//
// A pushbuffer needs to accomodate all possible operations on a 2 Mb Va region
// per gpu. The longest sequence of operations would be:
// Acquire 3 + 32 trackers:
// replay tracker, instancePtr tracker, 2Mb descriptor tracker and 32 trackers
// one each for 64Kb of phys mem.
// Each tracker can have ~64 tracker items  (35 x 64 x 20 bytes acquire  = 45k)
// Unmap 4k ptes for 2Mb va                 (Inline pte data + header    = ~4k)
// Invalidate for every 4k                  (512 * 20 bytes              = 10k)
// Migrate data worth 2 Mb                  (512 * 48 bytes to do copy   = 24k)
// Map 4k ptes for 2Mb va                   (4k inline pte data + header = ~4k)
// Invalidate for every 4k                  (512 * 20 bytes              = 10k)
// Total                                                            Total= ~100k
