// Populates the given VA range and tries to migrate all the pages to dst_id. If
// the destination processor is the CPU, the NUMA node in dst_node_id is used.
// The input VA range must be fully backed by VMAs. This function relies on
// migrate_vma, which was added in Linux 4.14. If skip_mapped is set to true,
// then already mapped pages will not be migrated. For kernels that do not
// provide migrate_vma, this function populates the memory using get_user_pages
// and returns NV_WARN_NOTHING_TO_DO to complete the migration in user space for
// API calls made from userspace. Kernel callers are expected to handle this
// error according to their respective usecases. user_space_start and
// user_space_length will contain the full input range. skip_mapped is ignored
// for such kernels. If the destination is the CPU and dst_node_id is full,
// NV_ERR_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED is returned and user-space will call
// UVM_MIGRATE with the next preferred CPU node (if more are available),
// starting at the address specified by user_space_start. If the destination is
// a GPU and a page could not be populated, return NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY. Otherwise,
// return NV_OK. This is fine because UvmMigrate/UvmMigrateAsync only guarantee
// that the memory is populated somewhere in the system, not that pages moved to
// the requested processor.
//
// migrate_vma does not support file-backed vmas yet. If a file-backed vma is
// found, populates the pages corresponding to the vma with get_user_pages() and
// returns NV_WARN_NOTHING_TO_DO. The caller is expected to handle this error.
// API calls will fall back to user-mode to complete the migration. Kernel
// callers are expected to handle this error according to the respective
// usecases. If NV_WARN_NOTHING_TO_DO is returned, user_space_start and
// user_space_length will contain the intersection of the vma address range and
// [start:start + length].
//
// If a user-mode fallback is required but current->mm != uvm_migrate_args->mm,
// NV_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED is returned since user mode can't perform such a
// migration. If the caller is a kernel thread, such as the GPU BH, this check
// is ignored since the caller is not expected to take such a fallback.
//
// Also, if no GPUs have been registered in the VA space, populates the pages
// corresponding to the first vma in the requested region using get_user_pages()
// and returns NV_WARN_NOTHING_TO_DO to fall back to user space for the
// userspace API callers to complete the whole migration. Kernel callers are
// expected to handle this error according to their respective usecases.
//
// If touch is true, a touch will be attempted on all pages in the requested
// range. All pages are only guaranteed to have been touched if
// NV_WARN_NOTHING_TO_DO or NV_OK is returned.
