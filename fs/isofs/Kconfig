config ISO9660_FS
	tristate "ISO 9660 CDROM file system support"
	help
	  This is the standard file system used on CD-ROMs.  It was previously
	  known as "High Sierra File System" and is called "hsfs" on other
	  Unix systems.  The so-called Rock-Ridge extensions which allow for
	  long Unix filenames and symbolic links are also supported by this
	  driver.  If you have a CD-ROM drive and want to do more with it than
	  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y (and read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/isofs.rst> and the CD-ROM-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), thereby
	  enlarging your kernel by about 27 KB; otherwise say N.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called isofs.

	help
	  Joliet is a Microsoft extension for the ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system
	  which allows for long filenames in unicode format (unicode is the
	  new 16 bit character code, successor to ASCII, which encodes the
	  characters of almost all languages of the world; see
	  <http://www.unicode.org/> for more information).  Say Y here if you
	  want to be able to read Joliet CD-ROMs under Linux.

config ZISOFS
	bool "Transparent decompression extension"
	depends on ISO9660_FS
	select ZLIB_INFLATE
	help
	  This is a Linux-specific extension to RockRidge which lets you store
	  data in compressed form on a CD-ROM and have it transparently
	  decompressed when the CD-ROM is accessed.  See
	  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/zisofs/> for the tools
	  necessary to create such a filesystem.  Say Y here if you want to be
	  able to read such compressed CD-ROMs.
