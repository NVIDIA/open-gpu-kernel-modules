	  NILFS2 is a log-structured file system (LFS) supporting continuous
	  snapshotting.  In addition to versioning capability of the entire
	  file system, users can even restore files mistakenly overwritten or
	  destroyed just a few seconds ago.  Since this file system can keep
	  consistency like conventional LFS, it achieves quick recovery after
	  system crashes.

	  NILFS2 creates a number of checkpoints every few seconds or per
	  synchronous write basis (unless there is no change).  Users can
	  select significant versions among continuously created checkpoints,
	  and can change them into snapshots which will be preserved for long
	  periods until they are changed back to checkpoints.  Each
	  snapshot is mountable as a read-only file system concurrently with
	  its writable mount, and this feature is convenient for online backup.

	  Some features including atime, extended attributes, and POSIX ACLs,
	  are not supported yet.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nilfs2.  If unsure, say N.
