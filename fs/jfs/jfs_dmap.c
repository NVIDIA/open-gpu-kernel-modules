/*
 *	SERIALIZATION of the Block Allocation Map.
 *
 *	the working state of the block allocation map is accessed in
 *	two directions:
 *
 *	1) allocation and free requests that start at the dmap
 *	   level and move up through the dmap control pages (i.e.
 *	   the vast majority of requests).
 *
 *	2) allocation requests that start at dmap control page
 *	   level and work down towards the dmaps.
 *
 *	the serialization scheme used here is as follows.
 *
 *	requests which start at the bottom are serialized against each
 *	other through buffers and each requests holds onto its buffers
 *	as it works it way up from a single dmap to the required level
 *	of dmap control page.
 *	requests that start at the top are serialized against each other
 *	and request that start from the bottom by the multiple read/single
 *	write inode lock of the bmap inode. requests starting at the top
 *	take this lock in write mode while request starting at the bottom
 *	take the lock in read mode.  a single top-down request may proceed
 *	exclusively while multiple bottoms-up requests may proceed
 *	simultaneously (under the protection of busy buffers).
 *
 *	in addition to information found in dmaps and dmap control pages,
 *	the working state of the block allocation map also includes read/
 *	write information maintained in the bmap descriptor (i.e. total
 *	free block count, allocation group level free block counts).
 *	a single exclusive lock (BMAP_LOCK) is used to guard this information
 *	in the face of multiple-bottoms up requests.
 *	(lock ordering: IREAD_LOCK, BMAP_LOCK);
 *
 *	accesses to the persistent state of the block allocation map (limited
 *	to the persistent bitmaps in dmaps) is guarded by (busy) buffers.
