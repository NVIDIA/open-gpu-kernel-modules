 * Sort the log items in the transaction.
 *
 * The ordering constraints are defined by the inode allocation and unlink
 * behaviour. The rules are:
 *
 *	1. Every item is only logged once in a given transaction. Hence it
 *	   represents the last logged state of the item. Hence ordering is
 *	   dependent on the order in which operations need to be performed so
 *	   required initial conditions are always met.
 *
 *	2. Cancelled buffers are recorded in pass 1 in a separate table and
 *	   there's nothing to replay from them so we can simply cull them
 *	   from the transaction. However, we can't do that until after we've
 *	   replayed all the other items because they may be dependent on the
 *	   cancelled buffer and replaying the cancelled buffer can remove it
 *	   form the cancelled buffer table. Hence they have tobe done last.
 *
 *	3. Inode allocation buffers must be replayed before inode items that
 *	   read the buffer and replay changes into it. For filesystems using the
 *	   ICREATE transactions, this means XFS_LI_ICREATE objects need to get
 *	   treated the same as inode allocation buffers as they create and
 *	   initialise the buffers directly.
 *
 *	4. Inode unlink buffers must be replayed after inode items are replayed.
 *	   This ensures that inodes are completely flushed to the inode buffer
 *	   in a "free" state before we remove the unlinked inode list pointer.
 *
 * Hence the ordering needs to be inode allocation buffers first, inode items
 * second, inode unlink buffers third and cancelled buffers last.
 *
 * But there's a problem with that - we can't tell an inode allocation buffer
 * apart from a regular buffer, so we can't separate them. We can, however,
 * tell an inode unlink buffer from the others, and so we can separate them out
 * from all the other buffers and move them to last.
 *
 * Hence, 4 lists, in order from head to tail:
 *	- buffer_list for all buffers except cancelled/inode unlink buffers
 *	- item_list for all non-buffer items
 *	- inode_buffer_list for inode unlink buffers
 *	- cancel_list for the cancelled buffers
 *
 * Note that we add objects to the tail of the lists so that first-to-last
 * ordering is preserved within the lists. Adding objects to the head of the
 * list means when we traverse from the head we walk them in last-to-first
 * order. For cancelled buffers and inode unlink buffers this doesn't matter,
 * but for all other items there may be specific ordering that we need to
 * preserve.
