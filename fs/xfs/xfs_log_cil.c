/*
 * Allocate or pin log vector buffers for CIL insertion.
 *
 * The CIL currently uses disposable buffers for copying a snapshot of the
 * modified items into the log during a push. The biggest problem with this is
 * the requirement to allocate the disposable buffer during the commit if:
 *	a) does not exist; or
 *	b) it is too small
 *
 * If we do this allocation within xlog_cil_insert_format_items(), it is done
 * under the xc_ctx_lock, which means that a CIL push cannot occur during
 * the memory allocation. This means that we have a potential deadlock situation
 * under low memory conditions when we have lots of dirty metadata pinned in
 * the CIL and we need a CIL commit to occur to free memory.
 *
 * To avoid this, we need to move the memory allocation outside the
 * xc_ctx_lock, but because the log vector buffers are disposable, that opens
 * up a TOCTOU race condition w.r.t. the CIL committing and removing the log
 * vector buffers between the check and the formatting of the item into the
 * log vector buffer within the xc_ctx_lock.
 *
 * Because the log vector buffer needs to be unchanged during the CIL push
 * process, we cannot share the buffer between the transaction commit (which
 * modifies the buffer) and the CIL push context that is writing the changes
 * into the log. This means skipping preallocation of buffer space is
 * unreliable, but we most definitely do not want to be allocating and freeing
 * buffers unnecessarily during commits when overwrites can be done safely.
 *
 * The simplest solution to this problem is to allocate a shadow buffer when a
 * log item is committed for the second time, and then to only use this buffer
 * if necessary. The buffer can remain attached to the log item until such time
 * it is needed, and this is the buffer that is reallocated to match the size of
 * the incoming modification. Then during the formatting of the item we can swap
 * the active buffer with the new one if we can't reuse the existing buffer. We
 * don't free the old buffer as it may be reused on the next modification if
 * it's size is right, otherwise we'll free and reallocate it at that point.
 *
 * This function builds a vector for the changes in each log item in the
 * transaction. It then works out the length of the buffer needed for each log
 * item, allocates them and attaches the vector to the log item in preparation
 * for the formatting step which occurs under the xc_ctx_lock.
 *
 * While this means the memory footprint goes up, it avoids the repeated
 * alloc/free pattern that repeated modifications of an item would otherwise
 * cause, and hence minimises the CPU overhead of such behaviour.

 *

 * guaranteed to be large enough for the current modification, but we will only

 * lv, then simple swap it out for the shadow lv. We don't free it - that is
 * done lazily either by th enext modification or the freeing of the log item.
 *
 * We don't set up region headers during this process; we simply copy the
 * regions into the flat buffer. We can do this because we still have to do a
 * formatting step to write the regions into the iclog buffer.  Writing the
 * ophdrs during the iclog write means that we can support splitting large
 * regions across iclog boundares without needing a change in the format of the
 * item/region encapsulation.
 *
