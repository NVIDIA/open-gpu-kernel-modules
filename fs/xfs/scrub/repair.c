/*
 * Reconstructing per-AG Btrees
 *
 * When a space btree is corrupt, we don't bother trying to fix it.  Instead,
 * we scan secondary space metadata to derive the records that should be in
 * the damaged btree, initialize a fresh btree root, and insert the records.
 * Note that for rebuilding the rmapbt we scan all the primary data to
 * generate the new records.
 *
 * However, that leaves the matter of removing all the metadata describing the
 * old broken structure.  For primary metadata we use the rmap data to collect
 * every extent with a matching rmap owner (bitmap); we then iterate all other
 * metadata structures with the same rmap owner to collect the extents that
 * cannot be removed (sublist).  We then subtract sublist from bitmap to
 * derive the blocks that were used by the old btree.  These blocks can be
 * reaped.
 *
 * For rmapbt reconstructions we must use different tactics for extent
 * collection.  First we iterate all primary metadata (this excludes the old
 * rmapbt, obviously) to generate new rmap records.  The gaps in the rmap
 * records are collected as bitmap.  The bnobt records are collected as
 * sublist.  As with the other btrees we subtract sublist from bitmap, and the
 * result (since the rmapbt lives in the free space) are the blocks from the
 * old rmapbt.
 *
 * Disposal of Blocks from Old per-AG Btrees
 *
 * Now that we've constructed a new btree to replace the damaged one, we want
 * to dispose of the blocks that (we think) the old btree was using.
 * Previously, we used the rmapbt to collect the extents (bitmap) with the
 * rmap owner corresponding to the tree we rebuilt, collected extents for any
 * blocks with the same rmap owner that are owned by another data structure
 * (sublist), and subtracted sublist from bitmap.  In theory the extents
 * remaining in bitmap are the old btree's blocks.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it's possible that the btree was crosslinked with other
 * blocks on disk.  The rmap data can tell us if there are multiple owners, so
 * if the rmapbt says there is an owner of this block other than @oinfo, then
 * the block is crosslinked.  Remove the reverse mapping and continue.
 *
 * If there is one rmap record, we can free the block, which removes the
 * reverse mapping but doesn't add the block to the free space.  Our repair
 * strategy is to hope the other metadata objects crosslinked on this block
 * will be rebuilt (atop different blocks), thereby removing all the cross
 * links.
 *
 * If there are no rmap records at all, we also free the block.  If the btree
 * being rebuilt lives in the free space (bnobt/cntbt/rmapbt) then there isn't
 * supposed to be a rmap record and everything is ok.  For other btrees there
 * had to have been an rmap entry for the block to have ended up on @bitmap,
 * so if it's gone now there's something wrong and the fs will shut down.
 *
 * Note: If there are multiple rmap records with only the same rmap owner as
 * the btree we're trying to rebuild and the block is indeed owned by another
 * data structure with the same rmap owner, then the block will be in sublist
 * and therefore doesn't need disposal.  If there are multiple rmap records
 * with only the same rmap owner but the block is not owned by something with
 * the same rmap owner, the block will be freed.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for locking the AG headers for the entire rebuild
 * operation so that nothing else can sneak in and change the AG state while
 * we're not looking.  We also assume that the caller already invalidated any
 * buffers associated with @bitmap.
