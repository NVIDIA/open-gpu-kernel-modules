/*
 * Online Scrub and Repair
 *
 * Traditionally, XFS (the kernel driver) did not know how to check or
 * repair on-disk data structures.  That task was left to the xfs_check
 * and xfs_repair tools, both of which require taking the filesystem
 * offline for a thorough but time consuming examination.  Online
 * scrub & repair, on the other hand, enables us to check the metadata
 * for obvious errors while carefully stepping around the filesystem's
 * ongoing operations, locking rules, etc.
 *
 * Given that most XFS metadata consist of records stored in a btree,
 * most of the checking functions iterate the btree blocks themselves
 * looking for irregularities.  When a record block is encountered, each
 * record can be checked for obviously bad values.  Record values can
 * also be cross-referenced against other btrees to look for potential
 * misunderstandings between pieces of metadata.
 *
 * It is expected that the checkers responsible for per-AG metadata
 * structures will lock the AG headers (AGI, AGF, AGFL), iterate the
 * metadata structure, and perform any relevant cross-referencing before
 * unlocking the AG and returning the results to userspace.  These
 * scrubbers must not keep an AG locked for too long to avoid tying up
 * the block and inode allocators.
 *
 * Block maps and b-trees rooted in an inode present a special challenge
 * because they can involve extents from any AG.  The general scrubber
 * structure of lock -> check -> xref -> unlock still holds, but AG
 * locking order rules /must/ be obeyed to avoid deadlocks.  The
 * ordering rule, of course, is that we must lock in increasing AG
 * order.  Helper functions are provided to track which AG headers we've
 * already locked.  If we detect an imminent locking order violation, we
 * can signal a potential deadlock, in which case the scrubber can jump
 * out to the top level, lock all the AGs in order, and retry the scrub.
 *
 * For file data (directories, extended attributes, symlinks) scrub, we
 * can simply lock the inode and walk the data.  For btree data
 * (directories and attributes) we follow the same btree-scrubbing
 * strategy outlined previously to check the records.
 *
 * We use a bit of trickery with transactions to avoid buffer deadlocks
 * if there is a cycle in the metadata.  The basic problem is that
 * travelling down a btree involves locking the current buffer at each
 * tree level.  If a pointer should somehow point back to a buffer that
 * we've already examined, we will deadlock due to the second buffer
 * locking attempt.  Note however that grabbing a buffer in transaction
 * context links the locked buffer to the transaction.  If we try to
 * re-grab the buffer in the context of the same transaction, we avoid
 * the second lock attempt and continue.  Between the verifier and the
 * scrubber, something will notice that something is amiss and report
 * the corruption.  Therefore, each scrubber will allocate an empty
 * transaction, attach buffers to it, and cancel the transaction at the
 * end of the scrub run.  Cancelling a non-dirty transaction simply
 * unlocks the buffers.
 *
 * There are four pieces of data that scrub can communicate to
 * userspace.  The first is the error code (errno), which can be used to
 * communicate operational errors in performing the scrub.  There are
 * also three flags that can be set in the scrub context.  If the data
 * structure itself is corrupt, the CORRUPT flag will be set.  If
 * the metadata is correct but otherwise suboptimal, the PREEN flag
 * will be set.
 *
 * We perform secondary validation of filesystem metadata by
 * cross-referencing every record with all other available metadata.
 * For example, for block mapping extents, we verify that there are no
 * records in the free space and inode btrees corresponding to that
 * space extent and that there is a corresponding entry in the reverse
 * mapping btree.  Inconsistent metadata is noted by setting the
 * XCORRUPT flag; btree query function errors are noted by setting the
 * XFAIL flag and deleting the cursor to prevent further attempts to
 * cross-reference with a defective btree.
 *
 * If a piece of metadata proves corrupt or suboptimal, the userspace
 * program can ask the kernel to apply some tender loving care (TLC) to
 * the metadata object by setting the REPAIR flag and re-calling the
 * scrub ioctl.  "Corruption" is defined by metadata violating the
 * on-disk specification; operations cannot continue if the violation is
 * left untreated.  It is possible for XFS to continue if an object is
 * "suboptimal", however performance may be degraded.  Repairs are
 * usually performed by rebuilding the metadata entirely out of
 * redundant metadata.  Optimizing, on the other hand, can sometimes be
 * done without rebuilding entire structures.
 *
 * Generally speaking, the repair code has the following code structure:
 * Lock -> scrub -> repair -> commit -> re-lock -> re-scrub -> unlock.
 * The first check helps us figure out if we need to rebuild or simply
 * optimize the structure so that the rebuild knows what to do.  The
 * second check evaluates the completeness of the repair; that is what
 * is reported to userspace.
 *
 * A quick note on symbol prefixes:
 * - "xfs_" are general XFS symbols.
 * - "xchk_" are symbols related to metadata checking.
 * - "xrep_" are symbols related to metadata repair.
 * - "xfs_scrub_" are symbols that tie online fsck to the rest of XFS.

/*
 * Scrub probe -- userspace uses this to probe if we're willing to scrub
 * or repair a given mountpoint.  This will be used by xfs_scrub to
 * probe the kernel's abilities to scrub (and repair) the metadata.  We
 * do this by validating the ioctl inputs from userspace, preparing the
 * filesystem for a scrub (or a repair) operation, and immediately
 * returning to userspace.  Userspace can use the returned errno and
 * structure state to decide (in broad terms) if scrub/repair are
 * supported by the running kernel.
