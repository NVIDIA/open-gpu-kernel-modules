/*
 * Scrub and In-Core Filesystem Health Assessments
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Online scrub and repair have the time and the ability to perform stronger
 * checks than we can do from the metadata verifiers, because they can
 * cross-reference records between data structures.  Therefore, scrub is in a
 * good position to update the online filesystem health assessments to reflect
 * the good/bad state of the data structure.
 *
 * We therefore extend scrub in the following ways to achieve this:
 *
 * 1. Create a "sick_mask" field in the scrub context.  When we're setting up a
 * scrub call, set this to the default XFS_SICK_* flag(s) for the selected
 * scrub type (call it A).  Scrub and repair functions can override the default
 * sick_mask value if they choose.
 *
 * 2. If the scrubber returns a runtime error code, we exit making no changes
 * to the incore sick state.
 *
 * 3. If the scrubber finds that A is clean, use sick_mask to clear the incore
 * sick flags before exiting.
 *
 * 4. If the scrubber finds that A is corrupt, use sick_mask to set the incore
 * sick flags.  If the user didn't want to repair then we exit, leaving the
 * metadata structure unfixed and the sick flag set.
 *
 * 5. Now we know that A is corrupt and the user wants to repair, so run the
 * repairer.  If the repairer returns an error code, we exit with that error
 * code, having made no further changes to the incore sick state.
 *
 * 6. If repair rebuilds A correctly and the subsequent re-scrub of A is clean,
 * use sick_mask to clear the incore sick flags.  This should have the effect
 * that A is no longer marked sick.
 *
 * 7. If repair rebuilds A incorrectly, the re-scrub will find it corrupt and
 * use sick_mask to set the incore sick flags.  This should have no externally
 * visible effect since we already set them in step (4).
 *
 * There are some complications to this story, however.  For certain types of
 * complementary metadata indices (e.g. inobt/finobt), it is easier to rebuild
 * both structures at the same time.  The following principles apply to this
 * type of repair strategy:
 *
 * 8. Any repair function that rebuilds multiple structures should update
 * sick_mask_visible to reflect whatever other structures are rebuilt, and
 * verify that all the rebuilt structures can pass a scrub check.  The outcomes
 * of 5-7 still apply, but with a sick_mask that covers everything being
 * rebuilt.
