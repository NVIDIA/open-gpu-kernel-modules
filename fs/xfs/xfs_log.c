 * Write some region out to in-core log

 * This will be called when writing externally provided regions or when

 *
 * General algorithm:
 *	1. Find total length of this write.  This may include adding to the
 *		lengths passed in.
 *	2. Check whether we violate the tickets reservation.
 *	3. While writing to this iclog
 *	    A. Reserve as much space in this iclog as can get
 *	    B. If this is first write, save away start lsn
 *	    C. While writing this region:
 *		1. If first write of transaction, write start record
 *		2. Write log operation header (header per region)
 *		3. Find out if we can fit entire region into this iclog
 *		4. Potentially, verify destination memcpy ptr
 *		5. Memcpy (partial) region
 *		6. If partial copy, release iclog; otherwise, continue
 *			copying more regions into current iclog
 *	4. Mark want sync bit (in simulation mode)
 *	5. Release iclog for potential flush to on-disk log.
 *
 * ERRORS:
 * 1.	Panic if reservation is overrun.  This should never happen since
 *	reservation amounts are generated internal to the filesystem.
 * NOTES:
 * 1. Tickets are single threaded data structures.
 * 2. The XLOG_END_TRANS & XLOG_CONTINUE_TRANS flags are passed down to the
 *	syncing routine.  When a single log_write region needs to span
 *	multiple in-core logs, the XLOG_CONTINUE_TRANS bit should be set
 *	on all log operation writes which don't contain the end of the
 *	region.  The XLOG_END_TRANS bit is used for the in-core log
 *	operation which contains the end of the continued log_write region.
 * 3. When xlog_state_get_iclog_space() grabs the rest of the current iclog,
 *	we don't really know exactly how much space will be used.  As a result,
 *	we don't update ic_offset until the end when we know exactly how many
