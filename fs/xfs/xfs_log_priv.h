 * Below are states for covering allocation transactions.
 * By covering, we mean changing the h_tail_lsn in the last on-disk
 * log write such that no allocation transactions will be re-done during
 * recovery after a system crash. Recovery starts at the last on-disk
 * log write.
 *
 * These states are used to insert dummy log entries to cover
 * space allocation transactions which can undo non-transactional changes
 * after a crash. Writes to a file with space
 * already allocated do not result in any transactions. Allocations
 * might include space beyond the EOF. So if we just push the EOF a
 * little, the last transaction for the file could contain the wrong
 * size. If there is no file system activity, after an allocation
 * transaction, and the system crashes, the allocation transaction
 * will get replayed and the file will be truncated. This could
 * be hours/days/... after the allocation occurred.
 *
 * The fix for this is to do two dummy transactions when the
 * system is idle. We need two dummy transaction because the h_tail_lsn
 * in the log record header needs to point beyond the last possible
 * non-dummy transaction. The first dummy changes the h_tail_lsn to
 * the first transaction before the dummy. The second dummy causes
 * h_tail_lsn to point to the first dummy. Recovery starts at h_tail_lsn.
 *
 * These dummy transactions get committed when everything
 * is idle (after there has been some activity).
 *
 * There are 5 states used to control this.
 *
 *  IDLE -- no logging has been done on the file system or
 *		we are done covering previous transactions.
 *  NEED -- logging has occurred and we need a dummy transaction
 *		when the log becomes idle.
 *  DONE -- we were in the NEED state and have committed a dummy
 *		transaction.
 *  NEED2 -- we detected that a dummy transaction has gone to the
 *		on disk log with no other transactions.
 *  DONE2 -- we committed a dummy transaction when in the NEED2 state.
 *
 * There are two places where we switch states:
 *
 * 1.) In xfs_sync, when we detect an idle log and are in NEED or NEED2.
 *	We commit the dummy transaction and switch to DONE or DONE2,
 *	respectively. In all other states, we don't do anything.
 *
 * 2.) When we finish writing the on-disk log (xlog_state_clean_log).
 *
 *	No matter what state we are in, if this isn't the dummy
 *	transaction going out, the next state is NEED.
 *	So, if we aren't in the DONE or DONE2 states, the next state
 *	is NEED. We can't be finishing a write of the dummy record
 *	unless it was committed and the state switched to DONE or DONE2.
 *
 *	If we are in the DONE state and this was a write of the
 *		dummy transaction, we move to NEED2.
 *
 *	If we are in the DONE2 state and this was a write of the
 *		dummy transaction, we move to IDLE.
 *
 *
 * Writing only one dummy transaction can get appended to
 * one file space allocation. When this happens, the log recovery
 * code replays the space allocation and a file could be truncated.
 * This is why we have the NEED2 and DONE2 states before going idle.

 * The amount of log space we allow the CIL to aggregate is difficult to size.
 * Whatever we choose, we have to make sure we can get a reservation for the
 * log space effectively, that it is large enough to capture sufficient
 * relogging to reduce log buffer IO significantly, but it is not too large for
 * the log or induces too much latency when writing out through the iclogs. We
 * track both space consumed and the number of vectors in the checkpoint
 * context, so we need to decide which to use for limiting.
 *
 * Every log buffer we write out during a push needs a header reserved, which
 * is at least one sector and more for v2 logs. Hence we need a reservation of
 * at least 512 bytes per 32k of log space just for the LR headers. That means
 * 16KB of reservation per megabyte of delayed logging space we will consume,
 * plus various headers.  The number of headers will vary based on the num of
 * io vectors, so limiting on a specific number of vectors is going to result
 * in transactions of varying size. IOWs, it is more consistent to track and
 * limit space consumed in the log rather than by the number of objects being
 * logged in order to prevent checkpoint ticket overruns.
 *
 * Further, use of static reservations through the log grant mechanism is
 * problematic. It introduces a lot of complexity (e.g. reserve grant vs write
 * grant) and a significant deadlock potential because regranting write space
 * can block on log pushes. Hence if we have to regrant log space during a log
 * push, we can deadlock.
 *
 * However, we can avoid this by use of a dynamic "reservation stealing"
 * technique during transaction commit whereby unused reservation space in the
 * transaction ticket is transferred to the CIL ctx commit ticket to cover the
 * space needed by the checkpoint transaction. This means that we never need to
 * specifically reserve space for the CIL checkpoint transaction, nor do we
 * need to regrant space once the checkpoint completes. This also means the
 * checkpoint transaction ticket is specific to the checkpoint context, rather
 * than the CIL itself.
 *
 * With dynamic reservations, we can effectively make up arbitrary limits for
 * the checkpoint size so long as they don't violate any other size rules.
 * Recovery imposes a rule that no transaction exceed half the log, so we are
 * limited by that.  Furthermore, the log transaction reservation subsystem
 * tries to keep 25% of the log free, so we need to keep below that limit or we
 * risk running out of free log space to start any new transactions.
 *
 * In order to keep background CIL push efficient, we only need to ensure the
 * CIL is large enough to maintain sufficient in-memory relogging to avoid
 * repeated physical writes of frequently modified metadata. If we allow the CIL
 * to grow to a substantial fraction of the log, then we may be pinning hundreds
 * of megabytes of metadata in memory until the CIL flushes. This can cause
 * issues when we are running low on memory - pinned memory cannot be reclaimed,
 * and the CIL consumes a lot of memory. Hence we need to set an upper physical
 * size limit for the CIL that limits the maximum amount of memory pinned by the
 * CIL but does not limit performance by reducing relogging efficiency
 * significantly.
 *
 * As such, the CIL push threshold ends up being the smaller of two thresholds:
 * - a threshold large enough that it allows CIL to be pushed and progress to be
 *   made without excessive blocking of incoming transaction commits. This is
 *   defined to be 12.5% of the log space - half the 25% push threshold of the
 *   AIL.
 * - small enough that it doesn't pin excessive amounts of memory but maintains
 *   close to peak relogging efficiency. This is defined to be 16x the iclog
 *   buffer window (32MB) as measurements have shown this to be roughly the
 *   point of diminishing performance increases under highly concurrent
 *   modification workloads.
 *
 * To prevent the CIL from overflowing upper commit size bounds, we introduce a
 * new threshold at which we block committing transactions until the background
 * CIL commit commences and switches to a new context. While this is not a hard
 * limit, it forces the process committing a transaction to the CIL to block and
 * yeild the CPU, giving the CIL push work a chance to be scheduled and start
 * work. This prevents a process running lots of transactions from overfilling
 * the CIL because it is not yielding the CPU. We set the blocking limit at
 * twice the background push space threshold so we keep in line with the AIL
 * push thresholds.
 *
 * Note: this is not a -hard- limit as blocking is applied after the transaction
 * is inserted into the CIL and the push has been triggered. It is largely a
 * throttling mechanism that allows the CIL push to be scheduled and run. A hard
 * limit will be difficult to implement without introducing global serialisation
 * in the CIL commit fast path, and it's not at all clear that we actually need
 * such hard limits given the ~7 years we've run without a hard limit before
 * finding the first situation where a checkpoint size overflow actually
 * occurred. Hence the simple throttle, and an ASSERT check to tell us that
 * we've overrun the max size.
