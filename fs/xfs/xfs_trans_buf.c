 * Similar to xfs_trans_inode_buf(), this marks the buffer as a cluster of
 * dquots. However, unlike in inode buffer recovery, dquot buffers get
 * recovered in their entirety. (Hence, no XFS_BLI_DQUOT_ALLOC_BUF flag).
 * The only thing that makes dquot buffers different from regular
 * buffers is that we must not replay dquot bufs when recovering
 * if a _corresponding_ quotaoff has happened. We also have to distinguish
 * between usr dquot bufs and grp dquot bufs, because usr and grp quotas
 * can be turned off independently.
