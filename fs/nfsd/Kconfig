	  Choose Y here if you want to allow other computers to access
	  files residing on this system using Sun's Network File System
	  protocol.  To compile the NFS server support as a module,
	  choose M here: the module will be called nfsd.

	  You may choose to use a user-space NFS server instead, in which
	  case you can choose N here.

	  To export local file systems using NFS, you also need to install
	  user space programs which can be found in the Linux nfs-utils
	  package, available from http://linux-nfs.org/.  More detail about
	  the Linux NFS server implementation is available via the
	  exports(5) man page.

	  Below you can choose which versions of the NFS protocol are
	  available to clients mounting the NFS server on this system.
	  Support for NFS version 2 (RFC 1094) is always available when
	  CONFIG_NFSD is selected.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_V3
	bool "NFS server support for NFS version 3"
	depends on NFSD

	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for
	  version 3 of the NFS protocol (RFC 1813).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config NFSD_V3_ACL
	bool "NFS server support for the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension"
	depends on NFSD_V3
	select NFSD_V2_ACL
	help
	  Solaris NFS servers support an auxiliary NFSv3 ACL protocol that
	  never became an official part of the NFS version 3 protocol.
	  This protocol extension allows applications on NFS clients to
	  manipulate POSIX Access Control Lists on files residing on NFS
	  servers.  NFS servers enforce POSIX ACLs on local files whether
	  this protocol is available or not.

	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for the
	  NFSv3 ACL protocol extension allowing NFS clients to manipulate
	  POSIX ACLs on files exported by your system's NFS server.  NFS
	  clients which support the Solaris NFSv3 ACL protocol can then
	  access and modify ACLs on your NFS server.

	  To store ACLs on your NFS server, you also need to enable ACL-
	  related CONFIG options for your local file systems of choice.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This option enables support in your system's NFS server for
	  version 4 of the NFS protocol (RFC 3530).

	  To export files using NFSv4, you need to install additional user
	  space programs which can be found in the Linux nfs-utils package,
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.

	  If unsure, say N.

	select NFSD_PNFS
	select EXPORTFS_BLOCK_OPS
	help
	  This option enables support for the exporting pNFS block layouts
	  in the kernel's NFS server. The pNFS block layout enables NFS
	  clients to directly perform I/O to block devices accessible to both
	  the server and the clients.  See RFC 5663 for more details.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_SCSILAYOUT

	depends on NFSD_V4 && BLOCK
	select NFSD_PNFS
	select EXPORTFS_BLOCK_OPS
	select BLK_SCSI_REQUEST
	help
	  This option enables support for the exporting pNFS SCSI layouts
	  in the kernel's NFS server. The pNFS SCSI layout enables NFS
	  clients to directly perform I/O to SCSI devices accessible to both
	  the server and the clients.  See draft-ietf-nfsv4-scsi-layout for

config NFSD_FLEXFILELAYOUT

	depends on NFSD_V4
	select NFSD_PNFS
	help
	  This option enables support for the exporting pNFS Flex File
	  layouts in the kernel's NFS server. The pNFS Flex File  layout
	  enables NFS clients to directly perform I/O to NFSv3 devices
	  accessible to both the server and the clients.  See
	  draft-ietf-nfsv4-flex-files for more details.

	  Warning, this server implements the bare minimum functionality
	  to be a flex file server - it is for testing the client,
	  not for use in production.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_V4_2_INTER_SSC
	bool "NFSv4.2 inter server to server COPY"
	depends on NFSD_V4 && NFS_V4_2
	help
	  This option enables support for NFSv4.2 inter server to
	  server copy where the destination server calls the NFSv4.2
	  client to read the data to copy from the source server.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFSD_V4_SECURITY_LABEL
	bool "Provide Security Label support for NFSv4 server"
	depends on NFSD_V4 && SECURITY
	help

	Say Y here if you want enable fine-grained security label attribute
	support for NFS version 4.  Security labels allow security modules like
	SELinux and Smack to label files to facilitate enforcement of their policies.
	Without this an NFSv4 mount will have the same label on each file.

	If you do not wish to enable fine-grained security labels SELinux or
	Smack policies on NFSv4 files, say N.
