	  This is the proprietary file system used by the Rio Karma music
	  player and ReplayTV DVR.  Despite the name, this filesystem is not
	  more efficient than a standard FS for MPEG files, in fact likely
	  the opposite is true.  Say Y if you have either of these devices
	  and wish to mount its disk.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called omfs.  If unsure, say N.
