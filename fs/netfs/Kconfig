config NETFS_SUPPORT
	tristate
	help
	  This option enables support for network filesystems, including
	  helpers for high-level buffered I/O, abstracting out read
	  segmentation, local caching and transparent huge page support.

config NETFS_STATS
	bool "Gather statistical information on local caching"
	depends on NETFS_SUPPORT && PROC_FS
	help
	  This option causes statistical information to be gathered on local
	  caching and exported through file:

		/proc/fs/fscache/stats

	  The gathering of statistics adds a certain amount of overhead to
	  execution as there are a quite a few stats gathered, and on a
	  multi-CPU system these may be on cachelines that keep bouncing
	  between CPUs.  On the other hand, the stats are very useful for
	  debugging purposes.  Saying 'Y' here is recommended.
