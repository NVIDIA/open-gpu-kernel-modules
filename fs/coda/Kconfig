	  Coda is an advanced network file system, similar to NFS in that it
	  enables you to mount file systems of a remote server and access them
	  with regular Unix commands as if they were sitting on your hard
	  disk.  Coda has several advantages over NFS: support for
	  disconnected operation (e.g. for laptops), read/write server
	  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,
	  persistent client caches and write back caching.

	  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda
	  *client*.  You will need user level code as well, both for the
	  client and server.  Servers are currently user level, i.e. they need
	  no kernel support.  Please read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/coda.rst> and check out the Coda
	  home page <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>.

	  To compile the coda client support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called coda.
