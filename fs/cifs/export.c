  * Since cifs is a network file system, an "fsid" must be included for
  * any nfs exports file entries which refer to cifs paths.  In addition
  * the cifs mount must be mounted with the "serverino" option (ie use stable
  * server inode numbers instead of locally generated temporary ones).
  * Although cifs inodes do not use generation numbers (have generation number
  * of zero) - the inode number alone should be good enough for simple cases
  * in which users want to export cifs shares with NFS. The decode and encode
  * could be improved by using a new routine which expects 64 bit inode numbers
  * instead of the default 32 bit routines in fs/exportfs
