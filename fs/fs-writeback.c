 * To be called after a writeback attempt of an inode finishes and undoes
 * wbc_attach_and_unlock_inode().  Can be called under any context.
 *
 * As concurrent write sharing of an inode is expected to be very rare and
 * memcg only tracks page ownership on first-use basis severely confining
 * the usefulness of such sharing, cgroup writeback tracks ownership
 * per-inode.  While the support for concurrent write sharing of an inode
 * is deemed unnecessary, an inode being written to by different cgroups at
 * different points in time is a lot more common, and, more importantly,
 * charging only by first-use can too readily lead to grossly incorrect
 * behaviors (single foreign page can lead to gigabytes of writeback to be
 * incorrectly attributed).
 *
 * To resolve this issue, cgroup writeback detects the majority dirtier of
 * an inode and transfers the ownership to it.  To avoid unnnecessary
 * oscillation, the detection mechanism keeps track of history and gives
 * out the switch verdict only if the foreign usage pattern is stable over
 * a certain amount of time and/or writeback attempts.
 *
 * On each writeback attempt, @wbc tries to detect the majority writer
 * using Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm.  In addition to the byte
 * count from the majority voting, it also counts the bytes written for the
 * current wb and the last round's winner wb (max of last round's current
 * wb, the winner from two rounds ago, and the last round's majority
 * candidate).  Keeping track of the historical winner helps the algorithm
 * to semi-reliably detect the most active writer even when it's not the
 * absolute majority.
 *
 * Once the winner of the round is determined, whether the winner is
 * foreign or not and how much IO time the round consumed is recorded in
 * inode->i_wb_frn_history.  If the amount of recorded foreign IO time is
 * over a certain threshold, the switch verdict is given.

 * __mark_inode_dirty -	internal function to mark an inode dirty

 * @flags: what kind of dirty, e.g. I_DIRTY_SYNC.  This can be a combination of
 *	   multiple I_DIRTY_* flags, except that I_DIRTY_TIME can't be combined
 *	   with I_DIRTY_PAGES.
 *
 * Mark an inode as dirty.  We notify the filesystem, then update the inode's
 * dirty flags.  Then, if needed we add the inode to the appropriate dirty list.
 *
 * Most callers should use mark_inode_dirty() or mark_inode_dirty_sync()
 * instead of calling this directly.
 *
 * CAREFUL!  We only add the inode to the dirty list if it is hashed or if it
 * refers to a blockdev.  Unhashed inodes will never be added to the dirty list
 * even if they are later hashed, as they will have been marked dirty already.
 *
 * In short, ensure you hash any inodes _before_ you start marking them dirty.
 *
 * Note that for blockdevs, inode->dirtied_when represents the dirtying time of
 * the block-special inode (/dev/hda1) itself.  And the ->dirtied_when field of
 * the kernel-internal blockdev inode represents the dirtying time of the
 * blockdev's pages.  This is why for I_DIRTY_PAGES we always use
 * page->mapping->host, so the page-dirtying time is recorded in the internal
 * blockdev inode.
