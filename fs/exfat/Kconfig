	help
	  This allows you to mount devices formatted with the exFAT file system.
	  exFAT is typically used on SD-Cards or USB sticks.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  exfat.

config EXFAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET
	string "Default iocharset for exFAT"
	default "utf8"
	depends on EXFAT_FS
	help
	  Set this to the default input/output character set to use for
	  converting between the encoding that is used for user visible
	  filenames and the UTF-16 character encoding that the exFAT
	  filesystem uses.  This can be overridden with the "iocharset" mount
	  option for the exFAT filesystems.
