 *	@offsets: offsets of pointers in that branch (see ext4_block_to_path)
 *	@chain:	  place to store the pointers to partial indirect blocks
 *	@top:	  place to the (detached) top of branch
 *
 *	This is a helper function used by ext4_truncate().
 *
 *	When we do truncate() we may have to clean the ends of several
 *	indirect blocks but leave the blocks themselves alive. Block is
 *	partially truncated if some data below the new i_size is referred
 *	from it (and it is on the path to the first completely truncated
 *	data block, indeed).  We have to free the top of that path along
 *	with everything to the right of the path. Since no allocation
 *	past the truncation point is possible until ext4_truncate()
 *	finishes, we may safely do the latter, but top of branch may
 *	require special attention - pageout below the truncation point
 *	might try to populate it.
 *
 *	We atomically detach the top of branch from the tree, store the
 *	block number of its root in *@top, pointers to buffer_heads of
 *	partially truncated blocks - in @chain[].bh and pointers to
 *	their last elements that should not be removed - in
 *	@chain[].p. Return value is the pointer to last filled element
 *	of @chain.
 *
 *	The work left to caller to do the actual freeing of subtrees:
 *		a) free the subtree starting from *@top
 *		b) free the subtrees whose roots are stored in
 *			(@chain[i].p+1 .. end of @chain[i].bh->b_data)
 *		c) free the subtrees growing from the inode past the @chain[0].
