KSelfTest ARM64
===============

- These tests are arm64 specific and so not built or run but just skipped
  completely when env-variable ARCH is found to be different than 'arm64'
  and `uname -m` reports other than 'aarch64'.

- Holding true the above, ARM64 KSFT tests can be run within the KSelfTest
  framework using standard Linux top-level-makefile targets:

      $ make TARGETS=arm64 kselftest-clean
      $ make TARGETS=arm64 kselftest

      or

      $ make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=arm64 \
		INSTALL_PATH=<your-installation-path> install

      or, alternatively, only specific arm64/ subtargets can be picked:

      $ make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=arm64 ARM64_SUBTARGETS="tags signal" \
		INSTALL_PATH=<your-installation-path> install

   Further details on building and running KFST can be found in:
