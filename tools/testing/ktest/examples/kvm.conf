# This config is an example usage of ktest.pl with a kvm guest

# The guest is called 'Guest' and this would be something that
# could be run on the host to test a virtual machine target.

# This part is the same as test.conf  #

# The include files will set up the type of test to run. Just set TEST to
# which test you want to run.
#
# TESTS = patchcheck, randconfig, boot, test, config-bisect, bisect, min-config

# See the include/*.conf files that define these tests

# The example here assumes that Guest is running a Fedora release
# that uses dracut for its initfs. The POST_INSTALL will be executed
# after the install of the kernel and modules are complete.
#
POST_INSTALL = ${SSH} /sbin/dracut -f /boot/initramfs-test.img $KERNEL_VERSION

# Guests sometimes get stuck on reboot. We wait 3 seconds after running
# the reboot command and then  do a full power-cycle of the guest.
# This forces the guest to restart.

# We do the same after the halt command, but this time we wait 20 seconds.
POWEROFF_AFTER_HALT = 20


# As the defaults.conf file has a POWER_CYCLE option already defined,
# and options can not be defined in the same section more than once
# (all DEFAULTS sections are considered the same). We use the
# DEFAULTS OVERRIDE to tell ktest.pl to ignore the previous defined
# options, for the options set in the OVERRIDE section.
#
DEFAULTS OVERRIDE

# Instead of using the default POWER_CYCLE option defined in
# defaults.conf, we use virsh to cycle it. To do so, we destroy
# the guest, wait 5 seconds, and then start it up again.
# Crude, but effective.
#
POWER_CYCLE = virsh destroy ${MACHINE}; sleep 5; virsh start ${MACHINE}
