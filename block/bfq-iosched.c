 * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
 * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
 * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
 * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits, usage and
 * limitations can be found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.rst.
 *
 * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
 * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
 * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
 * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
 * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
 * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
 * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
 * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
 * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
 * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
 * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Each
 * process/queue is assigned a user-configurable weight, and B-WF2Q+
 * guarantees that each queue receives a fraction of the throughput
 * proportional to its weight. Thanks to the accurate policy of
 * B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high budgets to I/O-bound
 * processes issuing sequential requests (to boost the throughput),
 * and yet guarantee a low latency to interactive and soft real-time
 * applications.
 *
 * In particular, to provide these low-latency guarantees, BFQ
 * explicitly privileges the I/O of two classes of time-sensitive
 * applications: interactive and soft real-time. In more detail, BFQ
 * behaves this way if the low_latency parameter is set (default
 * configuration). This feature enables BFQ to provide applications in
 * these classes with a very low latency.
 *
 * To implement this feature, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether
 * the I/O requests in a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft
 * real-time application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is
 * said to be interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ
 * privileges the service of the queue, over that of non-interactive
 * and non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed,
 * mainly, by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we
 * call just weight-raising periods the time periods during which a
 * queue is privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
 *
 * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
 * detail in the comments on the function
 * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
 * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
 * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
 * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
 * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
 * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
 * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
 *
 * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
 * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
 * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
 * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
 * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
 * weight-raising for interactive queues.
 *
 * Finally, BFQ also features additional heuristics for
 * preserving both a low latency and a high throughput on NCQ-capable,
 * rotational or flash-based devices, and to get the job done quickly
 * for applications consisting in many I/O-bound processes.
 *
 * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
 * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
 * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
 * to 0.
 *
 * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial,
 * more theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader
 * can find in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as
 * well as formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the
 * properties.  With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these
 * papers, this implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the
 * ones that guarantee a low latency to interactive and soft real-time
 * applications, and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
 *
 * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, which is described in [2], together with
 * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used here to implement B-WF2Q+
 * with O(log N) complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF
 * in [3].

/*
 * When configured for computing the duration of the weight-raising

 * duration = (ref_rate / r) * ref_wr_duration,
 * where r is the peak rate of the device, and ref_rate and
 * ref_wr_duration are two reference parameters.  In particular,
 * ref_rate is the peak rate of the reference storage device (see
 * below), and ref_wr_duration is about the maximum time needed, with
 * BFQ and while reading two files in parallel, to load typical large
 * applications on the reference device (see the comments on
 * max_service_from_wr below, for more details on how ref_wr_duration
 * is obtained).  In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand
 * is, the more/less it takes to load applications with respect to the
 * reference device.  Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants
 * weight raising to interactive applications.
 *
 * BFQ uses two different reference pairs (ref_rate, ref_wr_duration),
 * depending on whether the device is rotational or non-rotational.
 *
 * In the following definitions, ref_rate[0] and ref_wr_duration[0]
 * are the reference values for a rotational device, whereas
 * ref_rate[1] and ref_wr_duration[1] are the reference values for a
 * non-rotational device. The reference rates are not the actual peak
 * rates of the devices used as a reference, but slightly lower
 * values. The reason for using slightly lower values is that the
 * peak-rate estimator tends to yield slightly lower values than the
 * actual peak rate (it can yield the actual peak rate only if there
 * is only one process doing I/O, and the process does sequential
 * I/O).
 *
 * The reference peak rates are measured in sectors/usec, left-shifted
 * by BFQ_RATE_SHIFT.

/*
 * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
 * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
 * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
 * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
 * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
 * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
 * while being weight-raised, these applications
 * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
 * low latency;
 * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
 * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
 * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
 *
 * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
 * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
 * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
 * interactive tasks is computed.
 *
 * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
 * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
 * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
 * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
 * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
 * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
 * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
 * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
 * sectors transferred.
 *
 * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
 * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
 * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
 * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
 * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
 * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
 * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
 * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
 * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
 * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
 * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
 * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
 * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
 *
 * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
 * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
 * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
 * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
 *
 * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
 * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
 * described at the beginning of these comments.

/*
 * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created
 * shortly after each other, then the processes associated with these
 * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
 * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
 * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
 * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
 * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
 * or device idling to their queues, unless these queues must be
 * protected from the I/O flowing through other active queues.
 *
 * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
 * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
 * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
 * treated in a different way.
 *
 * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
 * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
 * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
 * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
 * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
 * counterproductive, unless there are other active queues to isolate
 * these new queues from. If there no other active queues, then
 * weight-raising these new queues just lowers throughput in most
 * cases.
 *
 * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
 * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
 * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
 * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
 * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
 * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
 * related to the application with respect to all other
 * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
 * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
 * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
 * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
 *
 * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
 * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
 * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
 * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
 * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
 * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
 * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
 * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
 * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
 * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
 * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
 * hand.
 *
 * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
 * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
 * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
 * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
 * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
 * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
 *
 * Turning back to the next function, it is invoked only if there are
 * no active queues (apart from active queues that would belong to the
 * same, possible burst bfqq would belong to), and it implements all
 * the steps needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to
 * properly mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then
 * be treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by
 * maintaining a "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that
 * belong to the burst in progress. The list is then used to mark
 * these queues as belonging to a large burst if the burst does become
 * large. The main steps are the following.
 *
 * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
 *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
 *
 * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
 *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
 *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
 *   Q to the burst list
 *
 * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
 *   the large-burst threshold, then
 *
 *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
 *       large burst
 *
 *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
 *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
 *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
 *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
 *
 *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
 *
 * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
 *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
 *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
 *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
 *   as belonging to a large burst.
 *
 * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
 *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
 *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
 *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
 *
 *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
 *
 *        . the burst list is emptied
 *
 *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
 *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q
 *          after this step).

/*
 * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
 * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
 * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
 * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
 * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
 * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
 * goals below.
 *
 * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
 * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
 * expired for one of the following two reasons:
 *
 * - BFQQE_NO_MORE_REQUESTS bfqq did not enjoy any device idling
 *   and did not make it to issue a new request before its last
 *   request was served;
 *
 * - BFQQE_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
 *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
 *
 * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
 * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
 * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
 * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
 * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
 * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
 * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
 * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
 * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
 * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
 * to be taken.
 *
 * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
 * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
 * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
 * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
 * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
 * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
 * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
 * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
 * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
 * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
 * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
 * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
 * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
 * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
 * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
 * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
 * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
 * on this tricky aspect).
 *
 * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
 * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
 * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
 * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
 * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
 * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
 * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
 * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
 * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
 * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
 * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
 *
 * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
 * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
 * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
 * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
 * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
 * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
 * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
 * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
 * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
 * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
 * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
 * __bfq_activate_entity.
 *
 * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
 * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
 * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
 * timestamp than the in-service queue.	 That is, the next budget of
 * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
 * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
 * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
 * outstanding requests mentioned above.
 *
 * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
 * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
 * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
 * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
 * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
 * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
 * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
 * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
 * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
 * I/O, which may in turn cause loss of throughput. Finally, there may
 * even be no in-service queue when the next function is invoked (so,
 * no queue to compare timestamps with). Because of these facts, the
 * next function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid costly
 * operations, too frequent preemptions and too many dependencies on
 * the state of the scheduler: it requests the expiration of the
 * in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need to
 * recover a hole. Then it delegates to other parts of the code the
 * responsibility of handling the above case 2.

	 * bfqq_wants_to_preempt is true. However, if bfqq does not
	 * carry time-critical I/O, then bfqq's bandwidth is less
	 * important than that of queues that carry time-critical I/O.
	 * So, as a further constraint, we consider this case only if
	 * bfqq is at least as weight-raised, i.e., at least as time
	 * critical, as the in-service queue.
	 *
	 * The second case is that bfqq is in a higher priority class,
	 * or has a higher weight than the in-service queue. If this
	 * condition does not hold, we don't care because, even if
	 * bfqq does not start to be served immediately, the resulting
	 * delay for bfqq's I/O is however lower or much lower than
	 * the ideal completion time to be guaranteed to bfqq's I/O.
	 *
	 * In both cases, preemption is needed only if, according to
	 * the timestamps of both bfqq and of the in-service queue,
	 * bfqq actually is the next queue to serve. So, to reduce
	 * useless preemptions, the return value of
	 * next_queue_may_preempt() is considered in the next compound
	 * condition too. Yet next_queue_may_preempt() just checks a
	 * simple, necessary condition for bfqq to be the next queue
	 * to serve. In fact, to evaluate a sufficient condition, the
	 * timestamps of the in-service queue would need to be
	 * updated, and this operation is quite costly (see the
	 * comments on bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation()).
	 *
	 * As for throughput, we ask bfq_better_to_idle() whether we
	 * still need to plug I/O dispatching. If bfq_better_to_idle()
	 * says no, then plugging is not needed any longer, either to
	 * boost throughput or to perserve service guarantees. Then
	 * the best option is to stop plugging I/O, as not doing so
	 * would certainly lower throughput. We may end up in this
	 * case if: (1) upon a dispatch attempt, we detected that it
	 * was better to plug I/O dispatch, and to wait for a new
	 * request to arrive for the currently in-service queue, but
	 * (2) this switch of bfqq to busy changes the scenario.

	 * latency of bfqq's requests, as the service time of a single
	 * request is likely to be lower than the think time of bfqq;
	 * b) on the downside, after becoming empty, bfqq is likely to
	 * expire before getting its next request. With this request
	 * arrival pattern, it is very hard to sample total service
	 * times and update the inject limit accordingly (see comments
	 * on bfq_update_inject_limit()). So the limit is likely to be
	 * never, or at least seldom, updated.  As a consequence, by
	 * setting the limit to 1, we avoid that no injection ever
	 * occurs with bfqq. On the downside, this proactive step
	 * further reduces chances to actually compute the baseline
	 * total service time. Thus it reduces chances to execute the

 * Detect whether bfqq's I/O seems synchronized with that of some

 * receive new I/O only right after some I/O request of the other
 * queue has been completed. We call waker queue the other queue, and
 * we assume, for simplicity, that bfqq may have at most one waker
 * queue.
 *
 * A remarkable throughput boost can be reached by unconditionally
 * injecting the I/O of the waker queue, every time a new
 * bfq_dispatch_request happens to be invoked while I/O is being
 * plugged for bfqq.  In addition to boosting throughput, this
 * unblocks bfqq's I/O, thereby improving bandwidth and latency for
 * bfqq. Note that these same results may be achieved with the general
 * injection mechanism, but less effectively. For details on this
 * aspect, see the comments on the choice of the queue for injection
 * in bfq_select_queue().
 *
 * Turning back to the detection of a waker queue, a queue Q is deemed
 * as a waker queue for bfqq if, for three consecutive times, bfqq
 * happens to become non empty right after a request of Q has been
 * completed. In particular, on the first time, Q is tentatively set
 * as a candidate waker queue, while on the third consecutive time
 * that Q is detected, the field waker_bfqq is set to Q, to confirm
 * that Q is a waker queue for bfqq. These detection steps are
 * performed only if bfqq has a long think time, so as to make it more
 * likely that bfqq's I/O is actually being blocked by a
 * synchronization. This last filter, plus the above three-times
 * requirement, make false positives less likely.
 *
 * NOTE
 *
 * The sooner a waker queue is detected, the sooner throughput can be
 * boosted by injecting I/O from the waker queue. Fortunately,
 * detection is likely to be actually fast, for the following
 * reasons. While blocked by synchronization, bfqq has a long think
 * time. This implies that bfqq's inject limit is at least equal to 1
 * (see the comments in bfq_update_inject_limit()). So, thanks to
 * injection, the waker queue is likely to be served during the very
 * first I/O-plugging time interval for bfqq. This triggers the first
 * step of the detection mechanism. Thanks again to injection, the
 * candidate waker queue is then likely to be confirmed no later than
 * during the next I/O-plugging interval for bfqq.
 *
 * ISSUE
 *
 * On queue merging all waker information is lost.

/*
 * There is a case where idling does not have to be performed for
 * throughput concerns, but to preserve the throughput share of
 * the process associated with bfqq.
 *
 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
 * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired throughput
 * distribution only in a completely symmetric, or favorably
 * skewed scenario where:
 * (i-a) each of these processes must get the same throughput as
 *	 the others,
 * (i-b) in case (i-a) does not hold, it holds that the process
 *       associated with bfqq must receive a lower or equal
 *	 throughput than any of the other processes;
 * (ii)  the I/O of each process has the same properties, in
 *       terms of locality (sequential or random), direction
 *       (reads or writes), request sizes, greediness
 *       (from I/O-bound to sporadic), and so on;

 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive tends to treat the requests
 * of each process in about the same way as the requests of the
 * others, and thus to provide each of these processes with about the
 * same throughput.  This is exactly the desired throughput
 * distribution if (i-a) holds, or, if (i-b) holds instead, this is an
 * even more convenient distribution for (the process associated with)
 * bfqq.
 *
 * In contrast, in any asymmetric or unfavorable scenario, device
 * idling (I/O-dispatch plugging) is certainly needed to guarantee
 * that bfqq receives its assigned fraction of the device throughput
 * (see [1] for details).
 *
 * The problem is that idling may significantly reduce throughput with
 * certain combinations of types of I/O and devices. An important
 * example is sync random I/O on flash storage with command
 * queueing. So, unless bfqq falls in cases where idling also boosts
 * throughput, it is important to check conditions (i-a), i(-b) and
 * (ii) accurately, so as to avoid idling when not strictly needed for
 * service guarantees.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to thoroughly check
 * condition (ii). And, in case there are active groups, it becomes
 * very difficult to check conditions (i-a) and (i-b) too.  In fact,
 * if there are active groups, then, for conditions (i-a) or (i-b) to
 * become false 'indirectly', it is enough that an active group
 * contains more active processes or sub-groups than some other active
 * group. More precisely, for conditions (i-a) or (i-b) to become
 * false because of such a group, it is not even necessary that the
 * group is (still) active: it is sufficient that, even if the group
 * has become inactive, some of its descendant processes still have
 * some request already dispatched but still waiting for
 * completion. In fact, requests have still to be guaranteed their
 * share of the throughput even after being dispatched. In this
 * respect, it is easy to show that, if a group frequently becomes
 * inactive while still having in-flight requests, and if, when this
 * happens, the group is not considered in the calculation of whether
 * the scenario is asymmetric, then the group may fail to be
 * guaranteed its fair share of the throughput (basically because
 * idling may not be performed for the descendant processes of the
 * group, but it had to be).  We address this issue with the following
 * bi-modal behavior, implemented in the function
 * bfq_asymmetric_scenario().
 *
 * If there are groups with requests waiting for completion
 * (as commented above, some of these groups may even be
 * already inactive), then the scenario is tagged as
 * asymmetric, conservatively, without checking any of the
 * conditions (i-a), (i-b) or (ii). So the device is idled for bfqq.
 * This behavior matches also the fact that groups are created
 * exactly if controlling I/O is a primary concern (to
 * preserve bandwidth and latency guarantees).
 *
 * On the opposite end, if there are no groups with requests waiting
 * for completion, then only conditions (i-a) and (i-b) are actually
 * controlled, i.e., provided that conditions (i-a) or (i-b) holds,
 * idling is not performed, regardless of whether condition (ii)
 * holds.  In other words, only if conditions (i-a) and (i-b) do not
 * hold, then idling is allowed, and the device tends to be prevented
 * from queueing many requests, possibly of several processes. Since
 * there are no groups with requests waiting for completion, then, to
 * control conditions (i-a) and (i-b) it is enough to check just
 * whether all the queues with requests waiting for completion also
 * have the same weight.
 *
 * Not checking condition (ii) evidently exposes bfqq to the
 * risk of getting less throughput than its fair share.
 * However, for queues with the same weight, a further
 * mechanism, preemption, mitigates or even eliminates this
 * problem. And it does so without consequences on overall
 * throughput. This mechanism and its benefits are explained
 * in the next three paragraphs.
 *
 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
 * minimum of mid-term fairness.
 *
 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
 * queue.
 *
 * The motivation for using preemption instead of idling (for
 * queues with the same weight) is that, by not idling,
 * service guarantees are preserved (completely or at least in
 * part) without minimally sacrificing throughput. And, if
 * there is no active group, then the primary expectation for
 * this device is probably a high throughput.
 *
 * We are now left only with explaining the two sub-conditions in the
 * additional compound condition that is checked below for deciding
 * whether the scenario is asymmetric. To explain the first
 * sub-condition, we need to add that the function
 * bfq_asymmetric_scenario checks the weights of only
 * non-weight-raised queues, for efficiency reasons (see comments on
 * bfq_weights_tree_add()). Then the fact that bfqq is weight-raised
 * is checked explicitly here. More precisely, the compound condition
 * below takes into account also the fact that, even if bfqq is being
 * weight-raised, the scenario is still symmetric if all queues with
 * requests waiting for completion happen to be
 * weight-raised. Actually, we should be even more precise here, and
 * differentiate between interactive weight raising and soft real-time
 * weight raising.
 *
 * The second sub-condition checked in the compound condition is
 * whether there is a fair amount of already in-flight I/O not
 * belonging to bfqq. If so, I/O dispatching is to be plugged, for the
 * following reason. The drive may decide to serve in-flight
 * non-bfqq's I/O requests before bfqq's ones, thereby delaying the
 * arrival of new I/O requests for bfqq (recall that bfqq is sync). If
 * I/O-dispatching is not plugged, then, while bfqq remains empty, a
 * basically uncontrolled amount of I/O from other queues may be
 * dispatched too, possibly causing the service of bfqq's I/O to be
 * delayed even longer in the drive. This problem gets more and more
 * serious as the speed and the queue depth of the drive grow,
 * because, as these two quantities grow, the probability to find no
 * queue busy but many requests in flight grows too. By contrast,
 * plugging I/O dispatching minimizes the delay induced by already
 * in-flight I/O, and enables bfqq to recover the bandwidth it may
 * lose because of this delay.
 *
 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the following
 * unlucky scenario: if I/O-dispatch plugging is (correctly) disabled
 * in a time period during which all symmetry sub-conditions hold, and
 * therefore the device is allowed to enqueue many requests, but at
 * some later point in time some sub-condition stops to hold, then it
 * may become impossible to make requests be served in the desired
 * order until all the requests already queued in the device have been
 * served. The last sub-condition commented above somewhat mitigates
 * this problem for weight-raised queues.
 *
 * However, as an additional mitigation for this problem, we preserve
 * plugging for a special symmetric case that may suddenly turn into
 * asymmetric: the case where only bfqq is busy. In this case, not
 * expiring bfqq does not cause any harm to any other queues in terms
 * of service guarantees. In contrast, it avoids the following unlucky
 * sequence of events: (1) bfqq is expired, (2) a new queue with a
 * lower weight than bfqq becomes busy (or more queues), (3) the new
 * queue is served until a new request arrives for bfqq, (4) when bfqq
 * is finally served, there are so many requests of the new queue in
 * the drive that the pending requests for bfqq take a lot of time to
 * be served. In particular, event (2) may case even already
 * dispatched requests of bfqq to be delayed, inside the drive. So, to
 * avoid this series of events, the scenario is preventively declared
 * as asymmetric also if bfqq is the only busy queues

 * An important observation is in order: as discussed in the comments

 * queues, it is hard if ever possible to know when and for how long
 * an I/O request is processed by the device (apart from the trivial
 * I/O pattern where a new request is dispatched only after the
 * previous one has been completed). This makes it hard to evaluate
 * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
 * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
 * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
 * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
 * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
 * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
 * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
 * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
 * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
 * finishes.
 *
 * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
 * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
 * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
 * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
 * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this
 * function to evaluate the I/O speed of a process.

 * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two
 * requirements. First, the application must not require an average
 * bandwidth higher than the approximate bandwidth required to playback or
 * record a compressed high-definition video.
 * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
 * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
 * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
 * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
 *
 * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
 * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
 * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
 * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
 * and so on.
 * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
 * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
 * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
 * not.
 *
 * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
 * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
 * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
 * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
 * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
 * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
 * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
 * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
 * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
 * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
 * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
 * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
 * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
 * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
 * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
 * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
 *
 * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
 *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
 *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
 *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
 *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
 *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
 *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
 *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
 *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
 *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
 *     batch of its requests has been completed.
 *
 * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
 *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
 *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
 *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
 *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
 *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
 *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
 *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
 *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
 *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
 *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
 *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
 *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
 *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
 *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
 *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
 *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
 *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
 *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
 *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
 *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
 *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
 *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
 *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
 *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
 *
 * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
 * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
 * application, if the reference quantity was just
 * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
 * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
 *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
 *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
 *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
 *    is rather lower than the exact value.
 * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
 *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
 *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
 * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
 * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
 * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
 * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
 * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

		 * The next four mutually-exclusive ifs decide

		 *
		 * The first if checks whether the process associated
		 * with bfqq has also async I/O pending. If so, it
		 * injects such I/O unconditionally. Injecting async
		 * I/O from the same process can cause no harm to the
		 * process. On the contrary, it can only increase
		 * bandwidth and reduce latency for the process.
		 *
		 * The second if checks whether there happens to be a
		 * non-empty waker queue for bfqq, i.e., a queue whose
		 * I/O needs to be completed for bfqq to receive new
		 * I/O. This happens, e.g., if bfqq is associated with
		 * a process that does some sync. A sync generates
		 * extra blocking I/O, which must be completed before
		 * the process associated with bfqq can go on with its
		 * I/O. If the I/O of the waker queue is not served,
		 * then bfqq remains empty, and no I/O is dispatched,
		 * until the idle timeout fires for bfqq. This is
		 * likely to result in lower bandwidth and higher
		 * latencies for bfqq, and in a severe loss of total
		 * throughput. The best action to take is therefore to
		 * serve the waker queue as soon as possible. So do it
		 * (without relying on the third alternative below for
		 * eventually serving waker_bfqq's I/O; see the last
		 * paragraph for further details). This systematic
		 * injection of I/O from the waker queue does not
		 * cause any delay to bfqq's I/O. On the contrary,
		 * next bfqq's I/O is brought forward dramatically,
		 * for it is not blocked for milliseconds.
		 *
		 * The third if checks whether there is a queue woken
		 * by bfqq, and currently with pending I/O. Such a
		 * woken queue does not steal bandwidth from bfqq,
		 * because it remains soon without I/O if bfqq is not
		 * served. So there is virtually no risk of loss of
		 * bandwidth for bfqq if this woken queue has I/O
		 * dispatched while bfqq is waiting for new I/O.
		 *
		 * The fourth if checks whether bfqq is a queue for
		 * which it is better to avoid injection. It is so if
		 * bfqq delivers more throughput when served without
		 * any further I/O from other queues in the middle, or
		 * if the service times of bfqq's I/O requests both
		 * count more than overall throughput, and may be
		 * easily increased by injection (this happens if bfqq
		 * has a short think time). If none of these
		 * conditions holds, then a candidate queue for
		 * injection is looked for through
		 * bfq_choose_bfqq_for_injection(). Note that the
		 * latter may return NULL (for example if the inject
		 * limit for bfqq is currently 0).
		 *
		 * NOTE: motivation for the second alternative
		 *
		 * Thanks to the way the inject limit is updated in
		 * bfq_update_has_short_ttime(), it is rather likely
		 * that, if I/O is being plugged for bfqq and the
		 * waker queue has pending I/O requests that are
		 * blocking bfqq's I/O, then the fourth alternative
		 * above lets the waker queue get served before the
		 * I/O-plugging timeout fires. So one may deem the
		 * second alternative superfluous. It is not, because
		 * the fourth alternative may be way less effective in
		 * case of a synchronization. For two main
		 * reasons. First, throughput may be low because the
		 * inject limit may be too low to guarantee the same
		 * amount of injected I/O, from the waker queue or
		 * other queues, that the second alternative
		 * guarantees (the second alternative unconditionally
		 * injects a pending I/O request of the waker queue
		 * for each bfq_dispatch_request()). Second, with the
		 * fourth alternative, the duration of the plugging,
		 * i.e., the time before bfqq finally receives new I/O,
		 * may not be minimized, because the waker queue may
		 * happen to be served only after other queues.

/*
 * Many throughput-sensitive workloads are made of several parallel
 * I/O flows, with all flows generated by the same application, or
 * more generically by the same task (e.g., system boot). The most
 * counterproductive action with these workloads is plugging I/O
 * dispatch when one of the bfq_queues associated with these flows
 * remains temporarily empty.
 *
 * To avoid this plugging, BFQ has been using a burst-handling
 * mechanism for years now. This mechanism has proven effective for
 * throughput, and not detrimental for service guarantees. The
 * following function pushes this mechanism a little bit further,
 * basing on the following two facts.
 *
 * First, all the I/O flows of a the same application or task
 * contribute to the execution/completion of that common application
 * or task. So the performance figures that matter are total
 * throughput of the flows and task-wide I/O latency.  In particular,
 * these flows do not need to be protected from each other, in terms
 * of individual bandwidth or latency.
 *
 * Second, the above fact holds regardless of the number of flows.
 *
 * Putting these two facts together, this commits merges stably the
 * bfq_queues associated with these I/O flows, i.e., with the
 * processes that generate these IO/ flows, regardless of how many the
 * involved processes are.
 *
 * To decide whether a set of bfq_queues is actually associated with
 * the I/O flows of a common application or task, and to merge these
 * queues stably, this function operates as follows: given a bfq_queue,
 * say Q2, currently being created, and the last bfq_queue, say Q1,
 * created before Q2, Q2 is merged stably with Q1 if
 * - very little time has elapsed since when Q1 was created
 * - Q2 has the same ioprio as Q1
 * - Q2 belongs to the same group as Q1
 *
 * Merging bfq_queues also reduces scheduling overhead. A fio test
 * with ten random readers on /dev/nullb shows a throughput boost of
 * 40%, with a quadcore. Since BFQ's execution time amounts to ~50% of
 * the total per-request processing time, the above throughput boost
 * implies that BFQ's overhead is reduced by more than 50%.
 *
 * This new mechanism most certainly obsoletes the current
 * burst-handling heuristics. We keep those heuristics for the moment.

	 *
	 * On the opposite end, a non-zero inject limit may allow the
	 * I/O that blocks bfqq to be executed soon, and therefore
	 * bfqq to receive new I/O soon.
	 *
	 * But, if the blocking gets actually eliminated, then the
	 * next think-time sample for bfqq may be very low. This in
	 * turn may cause bfqq's think time to be deemed
	 * short. Without the 100 ms barrier, this new state change
	 * would cause the body of the next if to be executed
	 * immediately. But this would set to 0 the inject
	 * limit. Without injection, the blocking I/O would cause the
	 * think time of bfqq to become long again, and therefore the
	 * inject limit to be raised again, and so on. The only effect
	 * of such a steady oscillation between the two think-time
	 * states would be to prevent effective injection on bfqq.
	 *
	 * In contrast, if the inject limit is not reset during such a
	 * long time interval as 100 ms, then the number of short
	 * think time samples can grow significantly before the reset
	 * is performed. As a consequence, the think time state can
	 * become stable before the reset. Therefore there will be no
	 * state change when the 100 ms elapse, and no reset of the
	 * inject limit. The inject limit remains steadily equal to 1
	 * both during and after the 100 ms. So injection can be
	 * performed at all times, and throughput gets boosted.
	 *
	 * An inject limit equal to 1 is however in conflict, in
	 * general, with the fact that the think time of bfqq is
	 * short, because injection may be likely to delay bfqq's I/O
	 * (as explained in the comments in
	 * bfq_update_inject_limit()). But this does not happen in
	 * this special case, because bfqq's low think time is due to
	 * an effective handling of a synchronization, through
	 * injection. In this special case, bfqq's I/O does not get
	 * delayed by injection; on the contrary, bfqq's I/O is
	 * brought forward, because it is not blocked for
	 * milliseconds.
	 *
	 * In addition, serving the blocking I/O much sooner, and much
	 * more frequently than once per I/O-plugging timeout, makes
	 * it much quicker to detect a waker queue (the concept of
	 * waker queue is defined in the comments in
	 * bfq_add_request()). This makes it possible to start sooner
	 * to boost throughput more effectively, by injecting the I/O
	 * of the waker queue unconditionally on every
	 * bfq_dispatch_request().
	 *
	 * One last, important benefit of not resetting the inject
	 * limit before 100 ms is that, during this time interval, the
	 * base value for the total service time is likely to get
	 * finally computed for bfqq, freeing the inject limit from
	 * its relation with the think time.

	 * - by definition of a waker, Q1 blocks the I/O of Q2, i.e.,
	 *   some I/O of Q1 needs to be completed for new I/O of Q2
	 *   to arrive.  A notable example of waker is journald
	 * - so, Q1 and Q2 are in any respect the queues of two
	 *   cooperating processes (or of two cooperating sets of
	 *   processes): the goal of Q1's I/O is doing what needs to
	 *   be done so that new Q2's I/O can finally be
	 *   issued. Therefore, if the service of Q1's I/O is delayed,
	 *   then Q2's I/O is delayed too.  Conversely, if Q2's I/O is
	 *   delayed, the goal of Q1's I/O is hindered.
	 * - as a consequence, if some I/O of Q1/Q2 arrives while
	 *   Q2/Q1 is the only queue in service, there is absolutely
	 *   no point in delaying the service of such an I/O. The
	 *   only possible result is a throughput loss
	 * - so, when the above condition holds, the best option is to
	 *   have the new I/O dispatched as soon as possible
	 * - the most effective and efficient way to attain the above
	 *   goal is to put the new I/O directly in the dispatch
	 *   list
	 * - as an additional restriction, Q1 and Q2 must be the only
	 *   busy queues for this commit to put the I/O of Q2/Q1 in
	 *   the dispatch list.  This is necessary, because, if also

/*
 * The processes associated with bfqq may happen to generate their
 * cumulative I/O at a lower rate than the rate at which the device
 * could serve the same I/O. This is rather probable, e.g., if only
 * one process is associated with bfqq and the device is an SSD. It
 * results in bfqq becoming often empty while in service. In this
 * respect, if BFQ is allowed to switch to another queue when bfqq
 * remains empty, then the device goes on being fed with I/O requests,
 * and the throughput is not affected. In contrast, if BFQ is not
 * allowed to switch to another queue---because bfqq is sync and
 * I/O-dispatch needs to be plugged while bfqq is temporarily
 * empty---then, during the service of bfqq, there will be frequent
 * "service holes", i.e., time intervals during which bfqq gets empty
 * and the device can only consume the I/O already queued in its
 * hardware queues. During service holes, the device may even get to
 * remaining idle. In the end, during the service of bfqq, the device
 * is driven at a lower speed than the one it can reach with the kind
 * of I/O flowing through bfqq.
 *
 * To counter this loss of throughput, BFQ implements a "request
 * injection mechanism", which tries to fill the above service holes
 * with I/O requests taken from other queues. The hard part in this
 * mechanism is finding the right amount of I/O to inject, so as to
 * both boost throughput and not break bfqq's bandwidth and latency
 * guarantees. In this respect, the mechanism maintains a per-queue
 * inject limit, computed as below. While bfqq is empty, the injection
 * mechanism dispatches extra I/O requests only until the total number
 * of I/O requests in flight---i.e., already dispatched but not yet
 * completed---remains lower than this limit.
 *
 * A first definition comes in handy to introduce the algorithm by
 * which the inject limit is computed.  We define as first request for
 * bfqq, an I/O request for bfqq that arrives while bfqq is in
 * service, and causes bfqq to switch from empty to non-empty. The
 * algorithm updates the limit as a function of the effect of
 * injection on the service times of only the first requests of
 * bfqq. The reason for this restriction is that these are the
 * requests whose service time is affected most, because they are the
 * first to arrive after injection possibly occurred.
 *
 * To evaluate the effect of injection, the algorithm measures the
 * "total service time" of first requests. We define as total service
 * time of an I/O request, the time that elapses since when the
 * request is enqueued into bfqq, to when it is completed. This
 * quantity allows the whole effect of injection to be measured. It is
 * easy to see why. Suppose that some requests of other queues are
 * actually injected while bfqq is empty, and that a new request R
 * then arrives for bfqq. If the device does start to serve all or
 * part of the injected requests during the service hole, then,
 * because of this extra service, it may delay the next invocation of
 * the dispatch hook of BFQ. Then, even after R gets eventually
 * dispatched, the device may delay the actual service of R if it is
 * still busy serving the extra requests, or if it decides to serve,
 * before R, some extra request still present in its queues. As a
 * conclusion, the cumulative extra delay caused by injection can be
 * easily evaluated by just comparing the total service time of first
 * requests with and without injection.
 *
 * The limit-update algorithm works as follows. On the arrival of a
 * first request of bfqq, the algorithm measures the total time of the
 * request only if one of the three cases below holds, and, for each
 * case, it updates the limit as described below:
 *
 * (1) If there is no in-flight request. This gives a baseline for the
 *     total service time of the requests of bfqq. If the baseline has
 *     not been computed yet, then, after computing it, the limit is
 *     set to 1, to start boosting throughput, and to prepare the
 *     ground for the next case. If the baseline has already been
 *     computed, then it is updated, in case it results to be lower
 *     than the previous value.
 *
 * (2) If the limit is higher than 0 and there are in-flight
 *     requests. By comparing the total service time in this case with
 *     the above baseline, it is possible to know at which extent the
 *     current value of the limit is inflating the total service
 *     time. If the inflation is below a certain threshold, then bfqq
 *     is assumed to be suffering from no perceivable loss of its
 *     service guarantees, and the limit is even tentatively
 *     increased. If the inflation is above the threshold, then the
 *     limit is decreased. Due to the lack of any hysteresis, this
 *     logic makes the limit oscillate even in steady workload
 *     conditions. Yet we opted for it, because it is fast in reaching
 *     the best value for the limit, as a function of the current I/O
 *     workload. To reduce oscillations, this step is disabled for a
 *     short time interval after the limit happens to be decreased.
 *
 * (3) Periodically, after resetting the limit, to make sure that the
 *     limit eventually drops in case the workload changes. This is
 *     needed because, after the limit has gone safely up for a
 *     certain workload, it is impossible to guess whether the
 *     baseline total service time may have changed, without measuring
 *     it again without injection. A more effective version of this
 *     step might be to just sample the baseline, by interrupting
 *     injection only once, and then to reset/lower the limit only if
 *     the total service time with the current limit does happen to be
 *     too large.
 *
 * More details on each step are provided in the comments on the
 * pieces of code that implement these steps: the branch handling the
 * transition from empty to non empty in bfq_add_request(), the branch
 * handling injection in bfq_select_queue(), and the function
 * bfq_choose_bfqq_for_injection(). These comments also explain some
 * exceptions, made by the injection mechanism in some special cases.
