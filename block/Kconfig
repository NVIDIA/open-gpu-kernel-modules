       help
	 Provide block layer support for the kernel.

	 Disable this option to remove the block layer support from the
	 kernel. This may be useful for embedded devices.

	 If this option is disabled:

	   - block device files will become unusable
	   - some filesystems (such as ext3) will become unavailable.

	 Also, SCSI character devices and USB storage will be disabled since
	 they make use of various block layer definitions and facilities.

	 Say Y here unless you know you really don't want to mount disks and
	 suchlike.

	bool "Block layer SG support v4"
	default y
	select BLK_SCSI_REQUEST
	help
	  Saying Y here will enable generic SG (SCSI generic) v4 support
	  for any block device.

	  Unlike SG v3 (aka block/scsi_ioctl.c drivers/scsi/sg.c), SG v4
	  can handle complicated SCSI commands: tagged variable length cdbs
	  with bidirectional data transfers and generic request/response
	  protocols (e.g. Task Management Functions and SMP in Serial
	  Attached SCSI).

	  This option is required by recent UDEV versions to properly
	  access device serial numbers, etc.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config BLK_DEV_BSGLIB
	bool "Block layer SG support v4 helper lib"
	select BLK_DEV_BSG
	select BLK_SCSI_REQUEST

	  Subsystems will normally enable this if needed. Users will not
	  normally need to manually enable this.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY
	bool "Block layer data integrity support"
	help
	Some storage devices allow extra information to be
	stored/retrieved to help protect the data.  The block layer
	data integrity option provides hooks which can be used by
	filesystems to ensure better data integrity.

	Say yes here if you have a storage device that provides the
	T10/SCSI Data Integrity Field or the T13/ATA External Path
	Protection.  If in doubt, say N.

config BLK_DEV_ZONED
	bool "Zoned block device support"
	select MQ_IOSCHED_DEADLINE
	help
	Block layer zoned block device support. This option enables
	support for ZAC/ZBC/ZNS host-managed and host-aware zoned block
	devices.

	Say yes here if you have a ZAC, ZBC, or ZNS storage device.

config BLK_DEV_THROTTLING
	bool "Block layer bio throttling support"
	depends on BLK_CGROUP=y
	select BLK_CGROUP_RWSTAT
	help
	Block layer bio throttling support. It can be used to limit
	the IO rate to a device. IO rate policies are per cgroup and
	one needs to mount and use blkio cgroup controller for creating
	cgroups and specifying per device IO rate policies.

	See Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/blkio-controller.rst for more information.

config BLK_DEV_THROTTLING_LOW
	bool "Block throttling .low limit interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on BLK_DEV_THROTTLING
	help
	Add .low limit interface for block throttling. The low limit is a best
	effort limit to prioritize cgroups. Depending on the setting, the limit
	can be used to protect cgroups in terms of bandwidth/iops and better
	utilize disk resource.

	Note, this is an experimental interface and could be changed someday.

config BLK_CMDLINE_PARSER
	bool "Block device command line partition parser"
	help
	Enabling this option allows you to specify the partition layout from
	the kernel boot args.  This is typically of use for embedded devices
	which don't otherwise have any standardized method for listing the
	partitions on a block device.

	See Documentation/block/cmdline-partition.rst for more information.

config BLK_WBT
	bool "Enable support for block device writeback throttling"
	help
	Enabling this option enables the block layer to throttle buffered
	background writeback from the VM, making it more smooth and having
	less impact on foreground operations. The throttling is done
	dynamically on an algorithm loosely based on CoDel, factoring in
	the realtime performance of the disk.

config BLK_CGROUP_IOLATENCY
	bool "Enable support for latency based cgroup IO protection"
	depends on BLK_CGROUP=y
	help
	Enabling this option enables the .latency interface for IO throttling.
	The IO controller will attempt to maintain average IO latencies below
	the configured latency target, throttling anybody with a higher latency
	target than the victimized group.

	Note, this is an experimental interface and could be changed someday.

config BLK_CGROUP_IOCOST
	bool "Enable support for cost model based cgroup IO controller"
	depends on BLK_CGROUP=y
	select BLK_RQ_IO_DATA_LEN
	select BLK_RQ_ALLOC_TIME
	help
	Enabling this option enables the .weight interface for cost
	model based proportional IO control.  The IO controller
	distributes IO capacity between different groups based on
	their share of the overall weight distribution.

config BLK_WBT_MQ
	bool "Multiqueue writeback throttling"
	default y
	depends on BLK_WBT
	help
	Enable writeback throttling by default on multiqueue devices.

config BLK_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Block layer debugging information in debugfs"
	default y
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	Include block layer debugging information in debugfs. This information
	is mostly useful for kernel developers, but it doesn't incur any cost
	at runtime.

	Unless you are building a kernel for a tiny system, you should
	say Y here.

config BLK_DEBUG_FS_ZONED
       bool
       default BLK_DEBUG_FS && BLK_DEV_ZONED

config BLK_SED_OPAL
	bool "Logic for interfacing with Opal enabled SEDs"
	help
	Builds Logic for interfacing with Opal enabled controllers.
	Enabling this option enables users to setup/unlock/lock
	Locking ranges for SED devices using the Opal protocol.

config BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION
	bool "Enable inline encryption support in block layer"
	help
	  Build the blk-crypto subsystem. Enabling this lets the
	  block layer handle encryption, so users can take
	  advantage of inline encryption hardware if present.

config BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION_FALLBACK
	bool "Enable crypto API fallback for blk-crypto"
	depends on BLK_INLINE_ENCRYPTION
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_SKCIPHER
	help
	  Enabling this lets the block layer handle inline encryption
	  by falling back to the kernel crypto API when inline
	  encryption hardware is not present.
