 *
 * bfq_sched_data is the basic scheduler queue.  It supports three
 * ioprio_classes, and can be used either as a toplevel queue or as an
 * intermediate queue in a hierarchical setup.
 *
 * The supported ioprio_classes are the same as in CFQ, in descending
 * priority order, IOPRIO_CLASS_RT, IOPRIO_CLASS_BE, IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE.
 * Requests from higher priority queues are served before all the
 * requests from lower priority queues; among requests of the same
 * queue requests are served according to B-WF2Q+.
 *
 * The schedule is implemented by the service trees, plus the field
 * @next_in_service, which points to the entity on the active trees
 * that will be served next, if 1) no changes in the schedule occurs
 * before the current in-service entity is expired, 2) the in-service
 * queue becomes idle when it expires, and 3) if the entity pointed by
 * in_service_entity is not a queue, then the in-service child entity
 * of the entity pointed by in_service_entity becomes idle on
 * expiration. This peculiar definition allows for the following
 * optimization, not yet exploited: while a given entity is still in
 * service, we already know which is the best candidate for next
 * service among the other active entities in the same parent
 * entity. We can then quickly compare the timestamps of the
 * in-service entity with those of such best candidate.

	 * carefulness: to avoid multiple decrements, we flag a group,
	 * more precisely an entity representing a group, as still
	 * counted in num_groups_with_pending_reqs when it becomes
	 * inactive. Then, when the first descendant queue of the
	 * entity remains with no request waiting for completion,
	 * num_groups_with_pending_reqs is decremented, and this flag
	 * is reset. After this flag is reset for the entity,

 * @bfqd: the bfq_data for the device this group acts upon.
 * @async_bfqq: array of async queues for all the tasks belonging to
 *              the group, one queue per ioprio value per ioprio_class,
 *              except for the idle class that has only one queue.

 * @my_entity: pointer to @entity, %NULL for the toplevel group; used
 *             to avoid too many special cases during group creation/
 *             migration.
 * @stats: stats for this bfqg.
 * @active_entities: number of active entities belonging to the group;
 *                   unused for the root group. Used to know whether there
 *                   are groups with more than one active @bfq_entity
 *                   (see the comments to the function

 * @rq_pos_tree: rbtree sorted by next_request position, used when
 *               determining if two or more queues have interleaving
 *               requests (see bfq_find_close_cooperator()).
 *
 * Each (device, cgroup) pair has its own bfq_group, i.e., for each cgroup
 * there is a set of bfq_groups, each one collecting the lower-level
 * entities belonging to the group that are acting on the same device.
 *
 * Locking works as follows:
 *    o @bfqd is protected by the queue lock, RCU is used to access it
 *      from the readers.
 *    o All the other fields are protected by the @bfqd queue lock.
