 * @cluster:	Point to start of cluster array.
 * @ncontrols:	Number of controls in cluster array.
 * @done:	Internal flag: set for each processed control.
 * @is_new:	Set when the user specified a new value for this control. It
 *		is also set when called from v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup(). Drivers

 * @has_changed: Set when the current value differs from the new value. Drivers
 *		should never use this flag.
 * @is_private: If set, then this control is private to its handler and it
 *		will not be added to any other handlers. Drivers can set
 *		this flag.
 * @is_auto:   If set, then this control selects whether the other cluster
 *		members are in 'automatic' mode or 'manual' mode. This is
 *		used for autogain/gain type clusters. Drivers should never
 *		set this flag directly.
 * @is_int:    If set, then this control has a simple integer value (i.e. it
 *		uses ctrl->val).
 * @is_string: If set, then this control has type %V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_STRING.
 * @is_ptr:	If set, then this control is an array and/or has type >=
 *		%V4L2_CTRL_COMPOUND_TYPES
 *		and/or has type %V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_STRING. In other words, &struct
 *		v4l2_ext_control uses field p to point to the data.
 * @is_array: If set, then this control contains an N-dimensional array.
 * @has_volatiles: If set, then one or more members of the cluster are volatile.
 *		Drivers should never touch this flag.
 * @call_notify: If set, then call the handler's notify function whenever the
 *		control's value changes.
 * @manual_mode_value: If the is_auto flag is set, then this is the value
 *		of the auto control that determines if that control is in
 *		manual mode. So if the value of the auto control equals this
 *		value, then the whole cluster is in manual mode. Drivers should
 *		never set this flag directly.
 * @ops:	The control ops.
 * @type_ops:	The control type ops.
 * @id:	The control ID.
 * @name:	The control name.
 * @type:	The control type.

 * @step:	The control's step value for non-menu controls.
 * @elems:	The number of elements in the N-dimensional array.
 * @elem_size:	The size in bytes of the control.
 * @dims:	The size of each dimension.
 * @nr_of_dims:The number of dimensions in @dims.
 * @menu_skip_mask: The control's skip mask for menu controls. This makes it
 *		easy to skip menu items that are not valid. If bit X is set,
 *		then menu item X is skipped. Of course, this only works for
 *		menus with <= 32 menu items. There are no menus that come
 *		close to that number, so this is OK. Should we ever need more,
 *		then this will have to be extended to a u64 or a bit array.
 * @qmenu:	A const char * array for all menu items. Array entries that are
 *		empty strings ("") correspond to non-existing menu items (this
 *		is in addition to the menu_skip_mask above). The last entry
 *		must be NULL.
 *		Used only if the @type is %V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_MENU.
 * @qmenu_int:	A 64-bit integer array for with integer menu items.
 *		The size of array must be equal to the menu size, e. g.:
 *		:math:`ceil(\frac{maximum - minimum}{step}) + 1`.
 *		Used only if the @type is %V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_INTEGER_MENU.
 * @flags:	The control's flags.
 * @cur:	Structure to store the current value.
 * @cur.val:	The control's current value, if the @type is represented via
 *		a u32 integer (see &enum v4l2_ctrl_type).
 * @val:	The control's new s32 value.
 * @priv:	The control's private pointer. For use by the driver. It is
 *		untouched by the control framework. Note that this pointer is
 *		not freed when the control is deleted. Should this be needed
 *		then a new internal bitfield can be added to tell the framework
 *		to free this pointer.
 * @p_def:	The control's default value represented via a union which
 *		provides a standard way of accessing control types
 *		through a pointer (for compound controls only).
 * @p_cur:	The control's current value represented via a union which
 *		provides a standard way of accessing control types
