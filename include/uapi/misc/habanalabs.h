 *
 * HW_IP_INFO            - Receive information about different IP blocks in the

 * HL_INFO_HW_EVENTS     - Receive an array describing how many times each event
 *                         occurred since the last hard reset.
 * HL_INFO_DRAM_USAGE    - Retrieve the dram usage inside the device and of the
 *                         specific context. This is relevant only for devices
 *                         where the dram is managed by the kernel driver
 * HL_INFO_HW_IDLE       - Retrieve information about the idle status of each
 *                         internal engine.
 * HL_INFO_DEVICE_STATUS - Retrieve the device's status. This opcode doesn't
 *                         require an open context.
 * HL_INFO_DEVICE_UTILIZATION  - Retrieve the total utilization of the device
 *                               over the last period specified by the user.
 *                               The period can be between 100ms to 1s, in
 *                               resolution of 100ms. The return value is a
 *                               percentage of the utilization rate.
 * HL_INFO_HW_EVENTS_AGGREGATE - Receive an array describing how many times each
 *                               event occurred since the driver was loaded.
 * HL_INFO_CLK_RATE            - Retrieve the current and maximum clock rate
 *                               of the device in MHz. The maximum clock rate is
 *                               configurable via sysfs parameter
 * HL_INFO_RESET_COUNT   - Retrieve the counts of the soft and hard reset
 *                         operations performed on the device since the last
 *                         time the driver was loaded.
 * HL_INFO_TIME_SYNC     - Retrieve the device's time alongside the host's time
 *                         for synchronization.
 * HL_INFO_CS_COUNTERS   - Retrieve command submission counters
 * HL_INFO_PCI_COUNTERS  - Retrieve PCI counters
 * HL_INFO_CLK_THROTTLE_REASON - Retrieve clock throttling reason
 * HL_INFO_SYNC_MANAGER  - Retrieve sync manager info per dcore
 * HL_INFO_TOTAL_ENERGY  - Retrieve total energy consumption
 * HL_INFO_PLL_FREQUENCY - Retrieve PLL frequency

 *

 * of JOBS. That set of JOBS constitutes a CS object.
 * Each JOB will be enqueued on a specific queue, according to the user's input.
 * There can be more then one JOB per queue.
 *
 * The CS IOCTL will receive two sets of JOBS. One set is for "restore" phase
 * and a second set is for "execution" phase.
 * The JOBS on the "restore" phase are enqueued only after context-switch
 * (or if its the first CS for this context). The user can also order the
 * driver to run the "restore" phase explicitly
 *
 * There are two types of queues - external and internal. External queues
 * are DMA queues which transfer data from/to the Host. All other queues are
 * internal. The driver will get completion notifications from the device only
 * on JOBS which are enqueued in the external queues.
 *
 * For jobs on external queues, the user needs to create command buffers
 * through the CB ioctl and give the CB's handle to the CS ioctl. For jobs on
 * internal queues, the user needs to prepare a "command buffer" with packets
 * on either the device SRAM/DRAM or the host, and give the device address of
 * that buffer to the CS ioctl.
 *
 * This IOCTL is asynchronous in regard to the actual execution of the CS. This
 * means it returns immediately after ALL the JOBS were enqueued on their
 * relevant queues. Therefore, the user mustn't assume the CS has been completed
 * or has even started to execute.
 *
 * Upon successful enqueue, the IOCTL returns a sequence number which the user
 * can use with the "Wait for CS" IOCTL to check whether the handle's CS
 * external JOBS have been completed. Note that if the CS has internal JOBS
 * which can execute AFTER the external JOBS have finished, the driver might
 * report that the CS has finished executing BEFORE the internal JOBS have
 * actually finished executing.
 *
 * Even though the sequence number increments per CS, the user can NOT
 * automatically assume that if CS with sequence number N finished, then CS
 * with sequence number N-1 also finished. The user can make this assumption if
 * and only if CS N and CS N-1 are exactly the same (same CBs for the same
 * queues).
