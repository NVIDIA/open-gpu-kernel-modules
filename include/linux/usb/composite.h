/*
 * This framework is an optional layer on top of the USB Gadget interface,
 * making it easier to build (a) Composite devices, supporting multiple
 * functions within any single configuration, and (b) Multi-configuration
 * devices, also supporting multiple functions but without necessarily
 * having more than one function per configuration.
 *
 * Example:  a device with a single configuration supporting both network
 * link and mass storage functions is a composite device.  Those functions
 * might alternatively be packaged in individual configurations, but in
 * the composite model the host can use both functions at the same time.

 * struct usb_function - describes one function of a configuration
 * @name: For diagnostics, identifies the function.

 *	and by language IDs provided in control requests
 * @fs_descriptors: Table of full (or low) speed descriptors, using interface and
 *	string identifiers assigned during @bind().  If this pointer is null,
 *	the function will not be available at full speed (or at low speed).
 * @hs_descriptors: Table of high speed descriptors, using interface and
 *	string identifiers assigned during @bind().  If this pointer is null,
 *	the function will not be available at high speed.
 * @ss_descriptors: Table of super speed descriptors, using interface and
 *	string identifiers assigned during @bind(). If this
 *	pointer is null after initiation, the function will not
 *	be available at super speed.
 * @ssp_descriptors: Table of super speed plus descriptors, using
 *	interface and string identifiers assigned during @bind(). If
 *	this pointer is null after initiation, the function will not
 *	be available at super speed plus.
 * @config: assigned when @usb_add_function() is called; this is the
 *	configuration with which this function is associated.
 * @os_desc_table: Table of (interface id, os descriptors) pairs. The function
 *	can expose more than one interface. If an interface is a member of
 *	an IAD, only the first interface of IAD has its entry in the table.
 * @os_desc_n: Number of entries in os_desc_table
 * @bind: Before the gadget can register, all of its functions bind() to the
 *	available resources including string and interface identifiers used
 *	in interface or class descriptors; endpoints; I/O buffers; and so on.
 * @unbind: Reverses @bind; called as a side effect of unregistering the
 *	driver which added this function.
 * @free_func: free the struct usb_function.
 * @mod: (internal) points to the module that created this structure.
 * @set_alt: (REQUIRED) Reconfigures altsettings; function drivers may
 *	initialize usb_ep.driver data at this time (when it is used).
 *	Note that setting an interface to its current altsetting resets
 *	interface state, and that all interfaces have a disabled state.
 * @get_alt: Returns the active altsetting.  If this is not provided,
 *	then only altsetting zero is supported.
 * @disable: (REQUIRED) Indicates the function should be disabled.  Reasons
 *	include host resetting or reconfiguring the gadget, and disconnection.
 * @setup: Used for interface-specific control requests.
 * @req_match: Tests if a given class request can be handled by this function.
 * @suspend: Notifies functions when the host stops sending USB traffic.
 * @resume: Notifies functions when the host restarts USB traffic.
 * @get_status: Returns function status as a reply to
 *	GetStatus() request when the recipient is Interface.
 * @func_suspend: callback to be called when
 *	SetFeature(FUNCTION_SUSPEND) is reseived
 *
 * A single USB function uses one or more interfaces, and should in most
 * cases support operation at both full and high speeds.  Each function is
 * associated by @usb_add_function() with a one configuration; that function
 * causes @bind() to be called so resources can be allocated as part of
 * setting up a gadget driver.  Those resources include endpoints, which
 * should be allocated using @usb_ep_autoconfig().
 *
 * To support dual speed operation, a function driver provides descriptors
 * for both high and full speed operation.  Except in rare cases that don't
 * involve bulk endpoints, each speed needs different endpoint descriptors.
 *
 * Function drivers choose their own strategies for managing instance data.
 * The simplest strategy just declares it "static', which means the function
 * can only be activated once.  If the function needs to be exposed in more
 * than one configuration at a given speed, it needs to support multiple
 * usb_function structures (one for each configuration).
 *
 * A more complex strategy might encapsulate a @usb_function structure inside
 * a driver-specific instance structure to allows multiple activations.  An
 * example of multiple activations might be a CDC ACM function that supports
 * two or more distinct instances within the same configuration, providing
 * several independent logical data links to a USB host.

 *
 * Configurations are building blocks for gadget drivers structured around
 * function drivers.  Simple USB gadgets require only one function and one
 * configuration, and handle dual-speed hardware by always providing the same
 * functionality.  Slightly more complex gadgets may have more than one
 * single-function configuration at a given speed; or have configurations
 * that only work at one speed.
 *
 * Composite devices are, by definition, ones with configurations which
 * include more than one function.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a usb_configuration includes allocation, initialization
 * of the fields described above, and calling @usb_add_config() to set up
 * internal data and bind it to a specific device.  The configuration's
 * @bind() method is then used to initialize all the functions and then
 * call @usb_add_function() for them.
 *
 * Those functions would normally be independent of each other, but that's
 * not mandatory.  CDC WMC devices are an example where functions often
 * depend on other functions, with some functions subsidiary to others.
 * Such interdependency may be managed in any way, so long as all of the
 * descriptors complete by the time the composite driver returns from
 * its bind() routine.
