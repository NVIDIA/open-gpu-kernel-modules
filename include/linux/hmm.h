 * HMM_PFN_WRITE - if the page memory can be written to (requires HMM_PFN_VALID)
 * HMM_PFN_ERROR - accessing the pfn is impossible and the device should
 *                 fail. ie poisoned memory, special pages, no vma, etc
 *
 * On input:
 * 0                 - Return the current state of the page, do not fault it.
 * HMM_PFN_REQ_FAULT - The output must have HMM_PFN_VALID or hmm_range_fault()
 *                     will fail
 * HMM_PFN_REQ_WRITE - The output must have HMM_PFN_WRITE or hmm_range_fault()
 *                     will fail. Must be combined with HMM_PFN_REQ_FAULT.
