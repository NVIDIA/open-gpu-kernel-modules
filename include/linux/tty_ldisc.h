/*
 * This structure defines the interface between the tty line discipline
 * implementation and the tty routines.  The following routines can be
 * defined; unless noted otherwise, they are optional, and can be
 * filled in with a null pointer.
 *
 * int	(*open)(struct tty_struct *);
 *
 *	This function is called when the line discipline is associated
 *	with the tty.  The line discipline can use this as an
 *	opportunity to initialize any state needed by the ldisc routines.
 *
 * void	(*close)(struct tty_struct *);
 *
 *	This function is called when the line discipline is being
 *	shutdown, either because the tty is being closed or because
 *	the tty is being changed to use a new line discipline
 *
 * void	(*flush_buffer)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 *	This function instructs the line discipline to clear its
 *	buffers of any input characters it may have queued to be
 *	delivered to the user mode process.
 *
 * ssize_t (*read)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file,
 *		   unsigned char * buf, size_t nr);
 *
 *	This function is called when the user requests to read from
 *	the tty.  The line discipline will return whatever characters
 *	it has buffered up for the user.  If this function is not
 *	defined, the user will receive an EIO error.
 *
 * ssize_t (*write)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file,
 *		    const unsigned char * buf, size_t nr);
 *
 *	This function is called when the user requests to write to the
 *	tty.  The line discipline will deliver the characters to the
 *	low-level tty device for transmission, optionally performing
 *	some processing on the characters first.  If this function is
 *	not defined, the user will receive an EIO error.
 *
 * int	(*ioctl)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file,
 *		 unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
 *
 *	This function is called when the user requests an ioctl which
 *	is not handled by the tty layer or the low-level tty driver.
 *	It is intended for ioctls which affect line discpline
 *	operation.  Note that the search order for ioctls is (1) tty
 *	layer, (2) tty low-level driver, (3) line discpline.  So a
 *	low-level driver can "grab" an ioctl request before the line
 *	discpline has a chance to see it.
 *
 * int	(*compat_ioctl)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file,
 *		        unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
 *
 *	Process ioctl calls from 32-bit process on 64-bit system
 *
 *	NOTE: only ioctls that are neither "pointer to compatible
 *	structure" nor tty-generic.  Something private that takes
 *	an integer or a pointer to wordsize-sensitive structure
 *	belongs here, but most of ldiscs will happily leave
 *	it NULL.
 *
 * void	(*set_termios)(struct tty_struct *tty, struct ktermios * old);
 *
 *	This function notifies the line discpline that a change has
 *	been made to the termios structure.
 *
 * int	(*poll)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * file,
 *		  poll_table *wait);
 *
 *	This function is called when a user attempts to select/poll on a
 *	tty device.  It is solely the responsibility of the line
 *	discipline to handle poll requests.
 *
 * void	(*receive_buf)(struct tty_struct *, const unsigned char *cp,
 *		       char *fp, int count);
 *
 *	This function is called by the low-level tty driver to send
 *	characters received by the hardware to the line discpline for
 *	processing.  <cp> is a pointer to the buffer of input
 *	character received by the device.  <fp> is a pointer to a
 *	pointer of flag bytes which indicate whether a character was
 *	received with a parity error, etc. <fp> may be NULL to indicate
 *	all data received is TTY_NORMAL.
 *
 * void	(*write_wakeup)(struct tty_struct *);
 *
 *	This function is called by the low-level tty driver to signal
 *	that line discpline should try to send more characters to the
 *	low-level driver for transmission.  If the line discpline does
 *	not have any more data to send, it can just return. If the line
 *	discipline does have some data to send, please arise a tasklet
 *	or workqueue to do the real data transfer. Do not send data in
 *	this hook, it may leads to a deadlock.
 *
 * int (*hangup)(struct tty_struct *)
 *
 *	Called on a hangup. Tells the discipline that it should
 *	cease I/O to the tty driver. Can sleep. The driver should
 *	seek to perform this action quickly but should wait until
 *	any pending driver I/O is completed.
 *
 * void (*dcd_change)(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int status)
 *
 *	Tells the discipline that the DCD pin has changed its status.
 *	Used exclusively by the N_PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) line discipline.
 *
 * int	(*receive_buf2)(struct tty_struct *, const unsigned char *cp,
 *			char *fp, int count);
 *
 *	This function is called by the low-level tty driver to send
 *	characters received by the hardware to the line discpline for
 *	processing.  <cp> is a pointer to the buffer of input
 *	character received by the device.  <fp> is a pointer to a
 *	pointer of flag bytes which indicate whether a character was
 *	received with a parity error, etc. <fp> may be NULL to indicate
 *	all data received is TTY_NORMAL.
 *	If assigned, prefer this function for automatic flow control.
