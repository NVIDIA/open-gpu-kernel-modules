 * with an extra smp_mb() like::

 *      CPU0 - waker                    CPU1 - waiter

 *
 * Because without the explicit smp_mb() it's possible for the
 * waitqueue_active() load to get hoisted over the @cond store such that we'll
 * observe an empty wait list while the waiter might not observe @cond.
 *
 * Also note that this 'optimization' trades a spin_lock() for an smp_mb(),
