/**
 * struct dev_pm_ops - device PM callbacks.
 *
 * @prepare: The principal role of this callback is to prevent new children of
 *	the device from being registered after it has returned (the driver's
 *	subsystem and generally the rest of the kernel is supposed to prevent
 *	new calls to the probe method from being made too once @prepare() has
 *	succeeded).  If @prepare() detects a situation it cannot handle (e.g.
 *	registration of a child already in progress), it may return -EAGAIN, so
 *	that the PM core can execute it once again (e.g. after a new child has
 *	been registered) to recover from the race condition.
 *	This method is executed for all kinds of suspend transitions and is
 *	followed by one of the suspend callbacks: @suspend(), @freeze(), or
 *	@poweroff().  If the transition is a suspend to memory or standby (that
 *	is, not related to hibernation), the return value of @prepare() may be
 *	used to indicate to the PM core to leave the device in runtime suspend
 *	if applicable.  Namely, if @prepare() returns a positive number, the PM
 *	core will understand that as a declaration that the device appears to be
 *	runtime-suspended and it may be left in that state during the entire
 *	transition and during the subsequent resume if all of its descendants
 *	are left in runtime suspend too.  If that happens, @complete() will be
 *	executed directly after @prepare() and it must ensure the proper
 *	functioning of the device after the system resume.
 *	The PM core executes subsystem-level @prepare() for all devices before
 *	starting to invoke suspend callbacks for any of them, so generally
 *	devices may be assumed to be functional or to respond to runtime resume
 *	requests while @prepare() is being executed.  However, device drivers
 *	may NOT assume anything about the availability of user space at that
 *	time and it is NOT valid to request firmware from within @prepare()
 *	(it's too late to do that).  It also is NOT valid to allocate
 *	substantial amounts of memory from @prepare() in the GFP_KERNEL mode.
 *	[To work around these limitations, drivers may register suspend and
 *	hibernation notifiers to be executed before the freezing of tasks.]
 *
 * @complete: Undo the changes made by @prepare().  This method is executed for
 *	all kinds of resume transitions, following one of the resume callbacks:
 *	@resume(), @thaw(), @restore().  Also called if the state transition
 *	fails before the driver's suspend callback: @suspend(), @freeze() or
 *	@poweroff(), can be executed (e.g. if the suspend callback fails for one
 *	of the other devices that the PM core has unsuccessfully attempted to
 *	suspend earlier).
 *	The PM core executes subsystem-level @complete() after it has executed
 *	the appropriate resume callbacks for all devices.  If the corresponding
 *	@prepare() at the beginning of the suspend transition returned a
 *	positive number and the device was left in runtime suspend (without
 *	executing any suspend and resume callbacks for it), @complete() will be
 *	the only callback executed for the device during resume.  In that case,
 *	@complete() must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to ensure the
 *	proper functioning of the device after the system resume.  To this end,
 *	@complete() can check the power.direct_complete flag of the device to
 *	learn whether (unset) or not (set) the previous suspend and resume
 *	callbacks have been executed for it.
 *
 * @suspend: Executed before putting the system into a sleep state in which the
 *	contents of main memory are preserved.  The exact action to perform
 *	depends on the device's subsystem (PM domain, device type, class or bus
 *	type), but generally the device must be quiescent after subsystem-level
 *	@suspend() has returned, so that it doesn't do any I/O or DMA.
 *	Subsystem-level @suspend() is executed for all devices after invoking
 *	subsystem-level @prepare() for all of them.
 *
 * @suspend_late: Continue operations started by @suspend().  For a number of
 *	devices @suspend_late() may point to the same callback routine as the
 *	runtime suspend callback.
 *
 * @resume: Executed after waking the system up from a sleep state in which the
 *	contents of main memory were preserved.  The exact action to perform
 *	depends on the device's subsystem, but generally the driver is expected
 *	to start working again, responding to hardware events and software
 *	requests (the device itself may be left in a low-power state, waiting
 *	for a runtime resume to occur).  The state of the device at the time its
 *	driver's @resume() callback is run depends on the platform and subsystem
 *	the device belongs to.  On most platforms, there are no restrictions on
 *	availability of resources like clocks during @resume().
 *	Subsystem-level @resume() is executed for all devices after invoking
 *	subsystem-level @resume_noirq() for all of them.
 *
 * @resume_early: Prepare to execute @resume().  For a number of devices
 *	@resume_early() may point to the same callback routine as the runtime
 *	resume callback.
 *
 * @freeze: Hibernation-specific, executed before creating a hibernation image.
 *	Analogous to @suspend(), but it should not enable the device to signal
 *	wakeup events or change its power state.  The majority of subsystems
 *	(with the notable exception of the PCI bus type) expect the driver-level
 *	@freeze() to save the device settings in memory to be used by @restore()
 *	during the subsequent resume from hibernation.
 *	Subsystem-level @freeze() is executed for all devices after invoking
 *	subsystem-level @prepare() for all of them.
 *
 * @freeze_late: Continue operations started by @freeze().  Analogous to
 *	@suspend_late(), but it should not enable the device to signal wakeup
 *	events or change its power state.
 *
 * @thaw: Hibernation-specific, executed after creating a hibernation image OR
 *	if the creation of an image has failed.  Also executed after a failing
 *	attempt to restore the contents of main memory from such an image.
 *	Undo the changes made by the preceding @freeze(), so the device can be
 *	operated in the same way as immediately before the call to @freeze().
 *	Subsystem-level @thaw() is executed for all devices after invoking
 *	subsystem-level @thaw_noirq() for all of them.  It also may be executed
 *	directly after @freeze() in case of a transition error.
 *
 * @thaw_early: Prepare to execute @thaw().  Undo the changes made by the
 *	preceding @freeze_late().
 *
 * @poweroff: Hibernation-specific, executed after saving a hibernation image.
 *	Analogous to @suspend(), but it need not save the device's settings in
 *	memory.
 *	Subsystem-level @poweroff() is executed for all devices after invoking
 *	subsystem-level @prepare() for all of them.
 *
 * @poweroff_late: Continue operations started by @poweroff().  Analogous to
 *	@suspend_late(), but it need not save the device's settings in memory.
 *
 * @restore: Hibernation-specific, executed after restoring the contents of main
 *	memory from a hibernation image, analogous to @resume().
 *
 * @restore_early: Prepare to execute @restore(), analogous to @resume_early().
 *
 * @suspend_noirq: Complete the actions started by @suspend().  Carry out any
 *	additional operations required for suspending the device that might be
 *	racing with its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to
 *	run while @suspend_noirq() is being executed.
 *	It generally is expected that the device will be in a low-power state
 *	(appropriate for the target system sleep state) after subsystem-level
 *	@suspend_noirq() has returned successfully.  If the device can generate
 *	system wakeup signals and is enabled to wake up the system, it should be
 *	configured to do so at that time.  However, depending on the platform
 *	and device's subsystem, @suspend() or @suspend_late() may be allowed to
 *	put the device into the low-power state and configure it to generate
 *	wakeup signals, in which case it generally is not necessary to define
 *	@suspend_noirq().
 *
 * @resume_noirq: Prepare for the execution of @resume() by carrying out any
 *	operations required for resuming the device that might be racing with
 *	its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
 *	@resume_noirq() is being executed.
 *
 * @freeze_noirq: Complete the actions started by @freeze().  Carry out any
 *	additional operations required for freezing the device that might be
 *	racing with its driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to
 *	run while @freeze_noirq() is being executed.
 *	The power state of the device should not be changed by either @freeze(),
 *	or @freeze_late(), or @freeze_noirq() and it should not be configured to
 *	signal system wakeup by any of these callbacks.
 *
 * @thaw_noirq: Prepare for the execution of @thaw() by carrying out any
 *	operations required for thawing the device that might be racing with its
 *	driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
 *	@thaw_noirq() is being executed.
 *
 * @poweroff_noirq: Complete the actions started by @poweroff().  Analogous to
 *	@suspend_noirq(), but it need not save the device's settings in memory.
 *
 * @restore_noirq: Prepare for the execution of @restore() by carrying out any
 *	operations required for thawing the device that might be racing with its
 *	driver's interrupt handler, which is guaranteed not to run while
 *	@restore_noirq() is being executed.  Analogous to @resume_noirq().
 *
 * @runtime_suspend: Prepare the device for a condition in which it won't be
 *	able to communicate with the CPU(s) and RAM due to power management.
 *	This need not mean that the device should be put into a low-power state.
 *	For example, if the device is behind a link which is about to be turned
 *	off, the device may remain at full power.  If the device does go to low
 *	power and is capable of generating runtime wakeup events, remote wakeup
 *	(i.e., a hardware mechanism allowing the device to request a change of
 *	its power state via an interrupt) should be enabled for it.
 *
 * @runtime_resume: Put the device into the fully active state in response to a
 *	wakeup event generated by hardware or at the request of software.  If
 *	necessary, put the device into the full-power state and restore its
 *	registers, so that it is fully operational.
 *
 * @runtime_idle: Device appears to be inactive and it might be put into a
 *	low-power state if all of the necessary conditions are satisfied.
 *	Check these conditions, and return 0 if it's appropriate to let the PM
 *	core queue a suspend request for the device.
 *
 * Several device power state transitions are externally visible, affecting
 * the state of pending I/O queues and (for drivers that touch hardware)
 * interrupts, wakeups, DMA, and other hardware state.  There may also be
 * internal transitions to various low-power modes which are transparent
 * to the rest of the driver stack (such as a driver that's ON gating off
 * clocks which are not in active use).
 *
 * The externally visible transitions are handled with the help of callbacks
 * included in this structure in such a way that, typically, two levels of
 * callbacks are involved.  First, the PM core executes callbacks provided by PM
 * domains, device types, classes and bus types.  They are the subsystem-level
 * callbacks expected to execute callbacks provided by device drivers, although
 * they may choose not to do that.  If the driver callbacks are executed, they
 * have to collaborate with the subsystem-level callbacks to achieve the goals
 * appropriate for the given system transition, given transition phase and the
 * subsystem the device belongs to.
 *
 * All of the above callbacks, except for @complete(), return error codes.
 * However, the error codes returned by @resume(), @thaw(), @restore(),
 * @resume_noirq(), @thaw_noirq(), and @restore_noirq(), do not cause the PM
 * core to abort the resume transition during which they are returned.  The
 * error codes returned in those cases are only printed to the system logs for
 * debugging purposes.  Still, it is recommended that drivers only return error
 * codes from their resume methods in case of an unrecoverable failure (i.e.
 * when the device being handled refuses to resume and becomes unusable) to
 * allow the PM core to be modified in the future, so that it can avoid
 * attempting to handle devices that failed to resume and their children.
 *
 * It is allowed to unregister devices while the above callbacks are being
 * executed.  However, a callback routine MUST NOT try to unregister the device
 * it was called for, although it may unregister children of that device (for
 * example, if it detects that a child was unplugged while the system was
 * asleep).
 *
 * There also are callbacks related to runtime power management of devices.
 * Again, as a rule these callbacks are executed by the PM core for subsystems
 * (PM domains, device types, classes and bus types) and the subsystem-level
 * callbacks are expected to invoke the driver callbacks.  Moreover, the exact
 * actions to be performed by a device driver's callbacks generally depend on
 * the platform and subsystem the device belongs to.
 *
 * Refer to Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst for more information about the
 * role of the @runtime_suspend(), @runtime_resume() and @runtime_idle()
 * callbacks in device runtime power management.

/*
 * One transition is triggered by resume(), after a suspend() call; the
 * message is implicit:
 *
 * ON		Driver starts working again, responding to hardware events
 *		and software requests.  The hardware may have gone through
 *		a power-off reset, or it may have maintained state from the
 *		previous suspend() which the driver will rely on while
 *		resuming.  On most platforms, there are no restrictions on
 *		availability of resources like clocks during resume().
 *
 * Other transitions are triggered by messages sent using suspend().  All
 * these transitions quiesce the driver, so that I/O queues are inactive.
 * That commonly entails turning off IRQs and DMA; there may be rules
 * about how to quiesce that are specific to the bus or the device's type.
 * (For example, network drivers mark the link state.)  Other details may
 * differ according to the message:
 *
 * SUSPEND	Quiesce, enter a low power device state appropriate for
 *		the upcoming system state (such as PCI_D3hot), and enable
 *		wakeup events as appropriate.
 *
 * HIBERNATE	Enter a low power device state appropriate for the hibernation
 *		state (eg. ACPI S4) and enable wakeup events as appropriate.
 *
 * FREEZE	Quiesce operations so that a consistent image can be saved;
 *		but do NOT otherwise enter a low power device state, and do
 *		NOT emit system wakeup events.
 *
 * PRETHAW	Quiesce as if for FREEZE; additionally, prepare for restoring
 *		the system from a snapshot taken after an earlier FREEZE.
 *		Some drivers will need to reset their hardware state instead
 *		of preserving it, to ensure that it's never mistaken for the
 *		state which that earlier snapshot had set up.
 *
 * A minimally power-aware driver treats all messages as SUSPEND, fully
 * reinitializes its device during resume() -- whether or not it was reset
 * during the suspend/resume cycle -- and can't issue wakeup events.
 *
 * More power-aware drivers may also use low power states at runtime as
 * well as during system sleep states like PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY.  They may
 * be able to use wakeup events to exit from runtime low-power states,
 * or from system low-power states such as standby or suspend-to-RAM.
