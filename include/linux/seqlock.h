 * esoteric cases which do not follow this pattern.
 *
 * As a consequence, we take the following best-effort approach for raw usage
 * via seqcount_t under KCSAN: upon beginning a seq-reader critical section,
 * pessimistically mark the next KCSAN_SEQLOCK_REGION_MAX memory accesses as
 * atomics; if there is a matching read_seqcount_retry() call, no following
 * memory operations are considered atomic. Usage of the seqlock_t interface
 * is not affected.

/**
 * raw_write_seqcount_latch() - redirect latch readers to even/odd copy
 * @s: Pointer to seqcount_latch_t
 *
 * The latch technique is a multiversion concurrency control method that allows
 * queries during non-atomic modifications. If you can guarantee queries never
 * interrupt the modification -- e.g. the concurrency is strictly between CPUs
 * -- you most likely do not need this.
 *
 * Where the traditional RCU/lockless data structures rely on atomic
 * modifications to ensure queries observe either the old or the new state the
 * latch allows the same for non-atomic updates. The trade-off is doubling the
 * cost of storage; we have to maintain two copies of the entire data
 * structure.
 *
 * Very simply put: we first modify one copy and then the other. This ensures
 * there is always one copy in a stable state, ready to give us an answer.
 *
 * The basic form is a data structure like::
 *
 *	struct latch_struct {
 *		seqcount_latch_t	seq;
 *		struct data_struct	data[2];
 *	};
 *
 * Where a modification, which is assumed to be externally serialized, does the
 * following::
 *
 *	void latch_modify(struct latch_struct *latch, ...)
 *	{
 *		smp_wmb();	// Ensure that the last data[1] update is visible
 *		latch->seq.sequence++;
 *		smp_wmb();	// Ensure that the seqcount update is visible
 *
 *		modify(latch->data[0], ...);
 *
 *		smp_wmb();	// Ensure that the data[0] update is visible
 *		latch->seq.sequence++;
 *		smp_wmb();	// Ensure that the seqcount update is visible
 *
 *		modify(latch->data[1], ...);
 *	}
 *
 * The query will have a form like::
 *
 *	struct entry *latch_query(struct latch_struct *latch, ...)
 *	{
 *		struct entry *entry;
 *		unsigned seq, idx;
 *
 *		do {
 *			seq = raw_read_seqcount_latch(&latch->seq);
 *
 *			idx = seq & 0x01;
 *			entry = data_query(latch->data[idx], ...);
 *
 *		// This includes needed smp_rmb()
 *		} while (read_seqcount_latch_retry(&latch->seq, seq));
 *
 *		return entry;
 *	}
 *
 * So during the modification, queries are first redirected to data[1]. Then we
 * modify data[0]. When that is complete, we redirect queries back to data[0]
 * and we can modify data[1].
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 *	The non-requirement for atomic modifications does _NOT_ include
 *	the publishing of new entries in the case where data is a dynamic
 *	data structure.
 *
 *	An iteration might start in data[0] and get suspended long enough
 *	to miss an entire modification sequence, once it resumes it might
 *	observe the new entry.
 *
 * NOTE2:
 *
 *	When data is a dynamic data structure; one should use regular RCU
 *	patterns to manage the lifetimes of the objects within.
