 * @PROBE_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS: Use this to annotate drivers that need
 *	their probe routines to run synchronously with driver and
 *	device registration (with the exception of -EPROBE_DEFER
 *	handling - re-probing always ends up being done asynchronously).
 *
 * Note that the end goal is to switch the kernel to use asynchronous
 * probing by default, so annotating drivers with
 * %PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS is a temporary measure that allows us
 * to speed up boot process while we are validating the rest of the

/**
 * struct device_driver - The basic device driver structure
 * @name:	Name of the device driver.
 * @bus:	The bus which the device of this driver belongs to.
 * @owner:	The module owner.
 * @mod_name:	Used for built-in modules.
 * @suppress_bind_attrs: Disables bind/unbind via sysfs.
 * @probe_type:	Type of the probe (synchronous or asynchronous) to use.
 * @of_match_table: The open firmware table.
 * @acpi_match_table: The ACPI match table.
 * @probe:	Called to query the existence of a specific device,
 *		whether this driver can work with it, and bind the driver
 *		to a specific device.
 * @sync_state:	Called to sync device state to software state after all the
 *		state tracking consumers linked to this device (present at
 *		the time of late_initcall) have successfully bound to a
 *		driver. If the device has no consumers, this function will
 *		be called at late_initcall_sync level. If the device has
 *		consumers that are never bound to a driver, this function
 *		will never get called until they do.
 * @remove:	Called when the device is removed from the system to
 *		unbind a device from this driver.
 * @shutdown:	Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device.
 * @suspend:	Called to put the device to sleep mode. Usually to a
 *		low power state.
 * @resume:	Called to bring a device from sleep mode.
 * @groups:	Default attributes that get created by the driver core
 *		automatically.
 * @dev_groups:	Additional attributes attached to device instance once
 *		it is bound to the driver.
 * @pm:		Power management operations of the device which matched
 *		this driver.
 * @coredump:	Called when sysfs entry is written to. The device driver
 *		is expected to call the dev_coredump API resulting in a
 *		uevent.
 * @p:		Driver core's private data, no one other than the driver
 *		core can touch this.
 *
 * The device driver-model tracks all of the drivers known to the system.
 * The main reason for this tracking is to enable the driver core to match
 * up drivers with new devices. Once drivers are known objects within the
 * system, however, a number of other things become possible. Device drivers
 * can export information and configuration variables that are independent
 * of any specific device.
