 * A resource table is essentially a list of system resources required

 * If needed, the remote processor firmware should contain this table
 * as a dedicated ".resource_table" ELF section.
 *
 * Some resources entries are mere announcements, where the host is informed
 * of specific remoteproc configuration. Other entries require the host to
 * do something (e.g. allocate a system resource). Sometimes a negotiation
 * is expected, where the firmware requests a resource, and once allocated,
 * the host should provide back its details (e.g. address of an allocated
 * memory region).
 *
 * The header of the resource table, as expressed by this structure,
 * contains a version number (should we need to change this format in the
 * future), the number of available resource entries, and their offsets
 * in the table.
 *
 * Immediately following this header are the resource entries themselves,
 * each of which begins with a resource entry header (as described below).

 * @name: human-readable name of the requested memory region
 *
 * This resource entry requests the host to allocate a physically contiguous
 * memory region.
 *
 * These request entries should precede other firmware resource entries,
 * as other entries might request placing other data objects inside
 * these memory regions (e.g. data/code segments, trace resource entries, ...).
 *
 * Allocating memory this way helps utilizing the reserved physical memory
 * (e.g. CMA) more efficiently, and also minimizes the number of TLB entries
 * needed to map it (in case @rproc is using an IOMMU). Reducing the TLB
 * pressure is important; it may have a substantial impact on performance.
 *
 * If the firmware is compiled with static addresses, then @da should specify
 * the expected device address of this memory region. If @da is set to
 * FW_RSC_ADDR_ANY, then the host will dynamically allocate it, and then
 * overwrite @da with the dynamically allocated address.
 *
 * We will always use @da to negotiate the device addresses, even if it
 * isn't using an iommu. In that case, though, it will obviously contain
 * physical addresses.
 *
 * Some remote processors needs to know the allocated physical address
 * even if they do use an iommu. This is needed, e.g., if they control
 * hardware accelerators which access the physical memory directly (this
 * is the case with OMAP4 for instance). In that case, the host will
 * overwrite @pa with the dynamically allocated physical address.
 * Generally we don't want to expose physical addresses if we don't have to
 * (remote processors are generally _not_ trusted), so we might want to
 * change this to happen _only_ when explicitly required by the hardware.
 *
 * @flags is used to provide IOMMU protection flags, and @name should
 * (optionally) contain a human readable name of this carveout region
 * (mainly for debugging purposes).
