 *                   device for the spidev
 * @max_dma_len: Maximum length of a DMA transfer for the device.
 * @prepare_transfer_hardware: a message will soon arrive from the queue
 *	so the subsystem requests the driver to prepare the transfer hardware
 *	by issuing this call
 * @transfer_one_message: the subsystem calls the driver to transfer a single
 *	message while queuing transfers that arrive in the meantime. When the
 *	driver is finished with this message, it must call
 *	spi_finalize_current_message() so the subsystem can issue the next
 *	message
 * @unprepare_transfer_hardware: there are currently no more messages on the
 *	queue so the subsystem notifies the driver that it may relax the
 *	hardware by issuing this call
 *
 * @set_cs: set the logic level of the chip select line.  May be called
 *          from interrupt context.
 * @prepare_message: set up the controller to transfer a single message,

 * @handle_err: the subsystem calls the driver to handle an error that occurs
 *		in the generic implementation of transfer_one_message().
 * @mem_ops: optimized/dedicated operations for interactions with SPI memory.
 *	     This field is optional and should only be implemented if the
 *	     controller has native support for memory like operations.
 * @unprepare_message: undo any work done by prepare_message().
 * @slave_abort: abort the ongoing transfer request on an SPI slave controller
 * @cs_setup: delay to be introduced by the controller after CS is asserted
 * @cs_hold: delay to be introduced by the controller before CS is deasserted
 * @cs_inactive: delay to be introduced by the controller after CS is
 *	deasserted. If @cs_change_delay is used from @spi_transfer, then the
 *	two delays will be added up.
 * @cs_gpios: LEGACY: array of GPIO descs to use as chip select lines; one per
 *	CS number. Any individual value may be -ENOENT for CS lines that
 *	are not GPIOs (driven by the SPI controller itself). Use the cs_gpiods
 *	in new drivers.
 * @cs_gpiods: Array of GPIO descs to use as chip select lines; one per CS
 *	number. Any individual value may be NULL for CS lines that
 *	are not GPIOs (driven by the SPI controller itself).
 * @use_gpio_descriptors: Turns on the code in the SPI core to parse and grab
 *	GPIO descriptors rather than using global GPIO numbers grabbed by the
 *	driver. This will fill in @cs_gpiods and @cs_gpios should not be used,
 *	and SPI devices will have the cs_gpiod assigned rather than cs_gpio.
 * @unused_native_cs: When cs_gpiods is used, spi_register_controller() will
 *	fill in this field with the first unused native CS, to be used by SPI
 *	controller drivers that need to drive a native CS when using GPIO CS.
 * @max_native_cs: When cs_gpiods is used, and this field is filled in,
 *	spi_register_controller() will validate all native CS (including the
 *	unused native CS) against this value.
 * @statistics: statistics for the spi_controller
 * @dma_tx: DMA transmit channel
 * @dma_rx: DMA receive channel
 * @dummy_rx: dummy receive buffer for full-duplex devices
 * @dummy_tx: dummy transmit buffer for full-duplex devices
 * @fw_translate_cs: If the boot firmware uses different numbering scheme
 *	what Linux expects, this optional hook can be used to translate
 *	between the two.
 * @ptp_sts_supported: If the driver sets this to true, it must provide a
 *	time snapshot in @spi_transfer->ptp_sts as close as possible to the
 *	moment in time when @spi_transfer->ptp_sts_word_pre and
 *	@spi_transfer->ptp_sts_word_post were transmitted.
 *	If the driver does not set this, the SPI core takes the snapshot as
 *	close to the driver hand-over as possible.
 * @irq_flags: Interrupt enable state during PTP system timestamping
 * @fallback: fallback to pio if dma transfer return failure with
 *	SPI_TRANS_FAIL_NO_START.
 *
 * Each SPI controller can communicate with one or more @spi_device
 * children.  These make a small bus, sharing MOSI, MISO and SCK signals
 * but not chip select signals.  Each device may be configured to use a
 * different clock rate, since those shared signals are ignored unless
 * the chip is selected.
 *
 * The driver for an SPI controller manages access to those devices through
 * a queue of spi_message transactions, copying data between CPU memory and
 * an SPI slave device.  For each such message it queues, it calls the

/**

 * @tx_dma: DMA address of tx_buf, if @spi_message.is_dma_mapped
 * @rx_dma: DMA address of rx_buf, if @spi_message.is_dma_mapped
 * @tx_nbits: number of bits used for writing. If 0 the default

 * @speed_hz: Select a speed other than the device default for this
 *      transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @bits_per_word: select a bits_per_word other than the device default
 *      for this transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @dummy_data: indicates transfer is dummy bytes transfer.
 * @cs_change: affects chipselect after this transfer completes
 * @cs_change_delay: delay between cs deassert and assert when
 *      @cs_change is set and @spi_transfer is not the last in @spi_message
 * @delay: delay to be introduced after this transfer before
 *	(optionally) changing the chipselect status, then starting
 *	the next transfer or completing this @spi_message.
 * @word_delay: inter word delay to be introduced after each word size
 *	(set by bits_per_word) transmission.
 * @effective_speed_hz: the effective SCK-speed that was used to
 *      transfer this transfer. Set to 0 if the spi bus driver does
 *      not support it.
 * @transfer_list: transfers are sequenced through @spi_message.transfers
 * @tx_sg: Scatterlist for transmit, currently not for client use
 * @rx_sg: Scatterlist for receive, currently not for client use
 * @ptp_sts_word_pre: The word (subject to bits_per_word semantics) offset
 *	within @tx_buf for which the SPI device is requesting that the time
 *	snapshot for this transfer begins. Upon completing the SPI transfer,
 *	this value may have changed compared to what was requested, depending
 *	on the available snapshotting resolution (DMA transfer,
 *	@ptp_sts_supported is false, etc).
 * @ptp_sts_word_post: See @ptp_sts_word_post. The two can be equal (meaning
 *	that a single byte should be snapshotted).
 *	If the core takes care of the timestamp (if @ptp_sts_supported is false
 *	for this controller), it will set @ptp_sts_word_pre to 0, and
 *	@ptp_sts_word_post to the length of the transfer. This is done
 *	purposefully (instead of setting to spi_transfer->len - 1) to denote
 *	that a transfer-level snapshot taken from within the driver may still
 *	be of higher quality.
 * @ptp_sts: Pointer to a memory location held by the SPI slave device where a
 *	PTP system timestamp structure may lie. If drivers use PIO or their
 *	hardware has some sort of assist for retrieving exact transfer timing,
 *	they can (and should) assert @ptp_sts_supported and populate this
 *	structure using the ptp_read_system_*ts helper functions.
 *	The timestamp must represent the time at which the SPI slave device has
 *	processed the word, i.e. the "pre" timestamp should be taken before
 *	transmitting the "pre" word, and the "post" timestamp after receiving
 *	transmit confirmation from the controller for the "post" word.
 * @timestamped: true if the transfer has been timestamped
 * @error: Error status logged by spi controller driver.
 *
 * SPI transfers always write the same number of bytes as they read.
 * Protocol drivers should always provide @rx_buf and/or @tx_buf.
 * In some cases, they may also want to provide DMA addresses for
 * the data being transferred; that may reduce overhead, when the
 * underlying driver uses dma.
 *
 * If the transmit buffer is null, zeroes will be shifted out
 * while filling @rx_buf.  If the receive buffer is null, the data
 * shifted in will be discarded.  Only "len" bytes shift out (or in).
 * It's an error to try to shift out a partial word.  (For example, by
 * shifting out three bytes with word size of sixteen or twenty bits;
 * the former uses two bytes per word, the latter uses four bytes.)
 *
 * In-memory data values are always in native CPU byte order, translated
 * from the wire byte order (big-endian except with SPI_LSB_FIRST).  So
 * for example when bits_per_word is sixteen, buffers are 2N bytes long
 * (@len = 2N) and hold N sixteen bit words in CPU byte order.
 *
 * When the word size of the SPI transfer is not a power-of-two multiple
 * of eight bits, those in-memory words include extra bits.  In-memory
 * words are always seen by protocol drivers as right-justified, so the
 * undefined (rx) or unused (tx) bits are always the most significant bits.
 *
 * All SPI transfers start with the relevant chipselect active.  Normally
 * it stays selected until after the last transfer in a message.  Drivers
 * can affect the chipselect signal using cs_change.
 *
 * (i) If the transfer isn't the last one in the message, this flag is
 * used to make the chipselect briefly go inactive in the middle of the
 * message.  Toggling chipselect in this way may be needed to terminate
 * a chip command, letting a single spi_message perform all of group of
 * chip transactions together.
 *
 * (ii) When the transfer is the last one in the message, the chip may
 * stay selected until the next transfer.  On multi-device SPI busses
 * with nothing blocking messages going to other devices, this is just
 * a performance hint; starting a message to another device deselects
 * this one.  But in other cases, this can be used to ensure correctness.
 * Some devices need protocol transactions to be built from a series of
 * spi_message submissions, where the content of one message is determined
 * by the results of previous messages and where the whole transaction
 * ends when the chipselect goes intactive.
 *
 * When SPI can transfer in 1x,2x or 4x. It can get this transfer information
 * from device through @tx_nbits and @rx_nbits. In Bi-direction, these
 * two should both be set. User can set transfer mode with SPI_NBITS_SINGLE(1x)
 * SPI_NBITS_DUAL(2x) and SPI_NBITS_QUAD(4x) to support these three transfer.
 *
 * The code that submits an spi_message (and its spi_transfers)
 * to the lower layers is responsible for managing its memory.
 * Zero-initialize every field you don't set up explicitly, to
 * insulate against future API updates.  After you submit a message
 * and its transfers, ignore them until its completion callback.

 * No SPI driver ever sees these SPI device table segments, but

 * the driver model tree.
 *
 * As a rule, SPI devices can't be probed.  Instead, board init code
 * provides a table listing the devices which are present, with enough
 * information to bind and set up the device's driver.  There's basic
 * support for nonstatic configurations too; enough to handle adding
 * parport adapters, or microcontrollers acting as USB-to-SPI bridges.

 * @modalias: Initializes spi_device.modalias; identifies the driver.
 * @platform_data: Initializes spi_device.platform_data; the particular

 * @swnode: Software node for the device.
 * @controller_data: Initializes spi_device.controller_data; some
 *	controllers need hints about hardware setup, e.g. for DMA.
 * @irq: Initializes spi_device.irq; depends on how the board is wired.
 * @max_speed_hz: Initializes spi_device.max_speed_hz; based on limits
 *	from the chip datasheet and board-specific signal quality issues.
 * @bus_num: Identifies which spi_controller parents the spi_device; unused

 * @chip_select: Initializes spi_device.chip_select; depends on how

 * @mode: Initializes spi_device.mode; based on the chip datasheet, board
 *	wiring (some devices support both 3WIRE and standard modes), and
 *	possibly presence of an inverter in the chipselect path.

 * populate a controller's device tree after the that controller's driver
