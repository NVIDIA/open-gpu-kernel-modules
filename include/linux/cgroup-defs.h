/*
 * sock_cgroup_data is embedded at sock->sk_cgrp_data and contains
 * per-socket cgroup information except for memcg association.
 *
 * On legacy hierarchies, net_prio and net_cls controllers directly set
 * attributes on each sock which can then be tested by the network layer.
 * On the default hierarchy, each sock is associated with the cgroup it was
 * created in and the networking layer can match the cgroup directly.
 *
 * To avoid carrying all three cgroup related fields separately in sock,
 * sock_cgroup_data overloads (prioidx, classid) and the cgroup pointer.
 * On boot, sock_cgroup_data records the cgroup that the sock was created
 * in so that cgroup2 matches can be made; however, once either net_prio or
 * net_cls starts being used, the area is overridden to carry prioidx and/or
 * classid.  The two modes are distinguished by whether the lowest bit is
 * set.  Clear bit indicates cgroup pointer while set bit prioidx and
 * classid.
 *
 * While userland may start using net_prio or net_cls at any time, once
 * either is used, cgroup2 matching no longer works.  There is no reason to
 * mix the two and this is in line with how legacy and v2 compatibility is
 * handled.  On mode switch, cgroup references which are already being
 * pointed to by socks may be leaked.  While this can be remedied by adding
 * synchronization around sock_cgroup_data, given that the number of leaked
 * cgroups is bound and highly unlikely to be high, this seems to be the
 * better trade-off.
