 * @error: Optional, only valid if < 0, must be set before calling
 * dma_fence_signal, indicates that the fence has completed with an error.
 *
 * the flags member must be manipulated and read using the appropriate

 * DMA_FENCE_FLAG_SIGNALED_BIT - fence is already signaled
 * DMA_FENCE_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_BIT - timestamp recorded for fence signaling
 * DMA_FENCE_FLAG_ENABLE_SIGNAL_BIT - enable_signaling might have been called

 * Particularly, if the bit was set, but dma_fence_signal was called right
 * before this bit was set, it would have been able to set the

 * Adding a check for DMA_FENCE_FLAG_SIGNALED_BIT after setting
 * DMA_FENCE_FLAG_ENABLE_SIGNAL_BIT closes this race, and makes sure that
 * after dma_fence_signal was called, any enable_signaling call will have either
