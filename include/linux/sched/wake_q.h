/*
 * Wake-queues are lists of tasks with a pending wakeup, whose
 * callers have already marked the task as woken internally,
 * and can thus carry on. A common use case is being able to
 * do the wakeups once the corresponding user lock as been
 * released.
 *
 * We hold reference to each task in the list across the wakeup,
 * thus guaranteeing that the memory is still valid by the time
 * the actual wakeups are performed in wake_up_q().
 *
 * One per task suffices, because there's never a need for a task to be
 * in two wake queues simultaneously; it is forbidden to abandon a task
 * in a wake queue (a call to wake_up_q() _must_ follow), so if a task is
 * already in a wake queue, the wakeup will happen soon and the second
 * waker can just skip it.
 *
 * The DEFINE_WAKE_Q macro declares and initializes the list head.
 * wake_up_q() does NOT reinitialize the list; it's expected to be
 * called near the end of a function. Otherwise, the list can be
 * re-initialized for later re-use by wake_q_init().
 *
 * NOTE that this can cause spurious wakeups. schedule() callers
 * must ensure the call is done inside a loop, confirming that the
 * wakeup condition has in fact occurred.
 *
 * NOTE that there is no guarantee the wakeup will happen any later than the
 * wake_q_add() location. Therefore task must be ready to be woken at the
 * location of the wake_q_add().
