/*
 * Hierarchical metaflags
 *
 * SHARED_CHILD: These flags are meant to be set from the base domain upwards.
 * If a domain has this flag set, all of its children should have it set. This
 * is usually because the flag describes some shared resource (all CPUs in that
 * domain share the same resource), or because they are tied to a scheduling
 * behaviour that we want to disable at some point in the hierarchy for
 * scalability reasons.
 *
 * In those cases it doesn't make sense to have the flag set for a domain but
 * not have it in (some of) its children: sched domains ALWAYS span their child
 * domains, so operations done with parent domains will cover CPUs in the lower
 * child domains.
 *
 *
 * SHARED_PARENT: These flags are meant to be set from the highest domain
 * downwards. If a domain has this flag set, all of its parents should have it
 * set. This is usually for topology properties that start to appear above a
 * certain level (e.g. domain starts spanning CPUs outside of the base CPU's
 * socket).
