 * @cur_altsetting: the current altsetting.
 * @num_altsetting: number of altsettings defined.
 * @intf_assoc: interface association descriptor
 * @minor: the minor number assigned to this interface, if this
 *	interface is bound to a driver that uses the USB major number.
 *	If this interface does not use the USB major, this field should
 *	be unused.  The driver should set this value in the probe()
 *	function of the driver, after it has been assigned a minor
 *	number from the USB core by calling usb_register_dev().
 * @condition: binding state of the interface: not bound, binding
 *	(in probe()), bound to a driver, or unbinding (in disconnect())
 * @sysfs_files_created: sysfs attributes exist
 * @ep_devs_created: endpoint child pseudo-devices exist
 * @unregistering: flag set when the interface is being unregistered
 * @needs_remote_wakeup: flag set when the driver requires remote-wakeup
 *	capability during autosuspend.
 * @needs_altsetting0: flag set when a set-interface request for altsetting 0
 *	has been deferred.
 * @needs_binding: flag set when the driver should be re-probed or unbound
 *	following a reset or suspend operation it doesn't support.
 * @authorized: This allows to (de)authorize individual interfaces instead
 *	a whole device in contrast to the device authorization.
 * @dev: driver model's view of this device
 * @usb_dev: if an interface is bound to the USB major, this will point
 *	to the sysfs representation for that device.
 * @reset_ws: Used for scheduling resets from atomic context.
 * @resetting_device: USB core reset the device, so use alt setting 0 as
 *	current; needs bandwidth alloc after reset.
 *
 * USB device drivers attach to interfaces on a physical device.  Each
 * interface encapsulates a single high level function, such as feeding
 * an audio stream to a speaker or reporting a change in a volume control.
 * Many USB devices only have one interface.  The protocol used to talk to
 * an interface's endpoints can be defined in a usb "class" specification,
 * or by a product's vendor.  The (default) control endpoint is part of
 * every interface, but is never listed among the interface's descriptors.
 *
 * The driver that is bound to the interface can use standard driver model
 * calls such as dev_get_drvdata() on the dev member of this structure.
 *
 * Each interface may have alternate settings.  The initial configuration
 * of a device sets altsetting 0, but the device driver can change
 * that setting using usb_set_interface().  Alternate settings are often
 * used to control the use of periodic endpoints, such as by having
 * different endpoints use different amounts of reserved USB bandwidth.
 * All standards-conformant USB devices that use isochronous endpoints
 * will use them in non-default settings.
 *
 * The USB specification says that alternate setting numbers must run from
 * 0 to one less than the total number of alternate settings.  But some
 * devices manage to mess this up, and the structures aren't necessarily
 * stored in numerical order anyhow.  Use usb_altnum_to_altsetting() to
 * look up an alternate setting in the altsetting array based on its number.

 *	return -ENODEV, if genuine IO errors occurred, an appropriate
 *	negative errno value.
 * @disconnect: Called when the interface is no longer accessible, usually
 *	because its device has been (or is being) disconnected or the
 *	driver module is being unloaded.
 * @unlocked_ioctl: Used for drivers that want to talk to userspace through
 *	the "usbfs" filesystem.  This lets devices provide ways to
 *	expose information to user space regardless of where they
 *	do (or don't) show up otherwise in the filesystem.
 * @suspend: Called when the device is going to be suspended by the
 *	system either from system sleep or runtime suspend context. The
 *	return value will be ignored in system sleep context, so do NOT
 *	try to continue using the device if suspend fails in this case.
 *	Instead, let the resume or reset-resume routine recover from
 *	the failure.
 * @resume: Called when the device is being resumed by the system.
 * @reset_resume: Called when the suspended device has been reset instead
 *	of being resumed.
 * @pre_reset: Called by usb_reset_device() when the device is about to be
 *	reset.  This routine must not return until the driver has no active
 *	URBs for the device, and no more URBs may be submitted until the
 *	post_reset method is called.
 * @post_reset: Called by usb_reset_device() after the device
 *	has been reset
 * @id_table: USB drivers use ID table to support hotplugging.
 *	Export this with MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb,...).  This must be set
 *	or your driver's probe function will never get called.
 * @dev_groups: Attributes attached to the device that will be created once it
 *	is bound to the driver.
 * @dynids: used internally to hold the list of dynamically added device
 *	ids for this driver.
 * @drvwrap: Driver-model core structure wrapper.
 * @no_dynamic_id: if set to 1, the USB core will not allow dynamic ids to be
 *	added to this driver by preventing the sysfs file from being created.
 * @supports_autosuspend: if set to 0, the USB core will not allow autosuspend
 *	for interfaces bound to this driver.
 * @soft_unbind: if set to 1, the USB core will not kill URBs and disable
 *	endpoints before calling the driver's disconnect method.
 * @disable_hub_initiated_lpm: if set to 1, the USB core will not allow hubs
 *	to initiate lower power link state transitions when an idle timeout
 *	occurs.  Device-initiated USB 3.0 link PM will still be allowed.
 *
 * USB interface drivers must provide a name, probe() and disconnect()
 * methods, and an id_table.  Other driver fields are optional.
 *
 * The id_table is used in hotplugging.  It holds a set of descriptors,
 * and specialized data may be associated with each entry.  That table
 * is used by both user and kernel mode hotplugging support.
 *
 * The probe() and disconnect() methods are called in a context where
 * they can sleep, but they should avoid abusing the privilege.  Most
 * work to connect to a device should be done when the device is opened,
 * and undone at the last close.  The disconnect code needs to address
 * concurrency issues with respect to open() and close() methods, as
 * well as forcing all pending I/O requests to complete (by unlinking
 * them as necessary, and blocking until the unlinks complete).

/**
 * struct urb - USB Request Block
 * @urb_list: For use by current owner of the URB.
 * @anchor_list: membership in the list of an anchor
 * @anchor: to anchor URBs to a common mooring
 * @ep: Points to the endpoint's data structure.  Will eventually
 *	replace @pipe.
 * @pipe: Holds endpoint number, direction, type, and more.
 *	Create these values with the eight macros available;
 *	usb_{snd,rcv}TYPEpipe(dev,endpoint), where the TYPE is "ctrl"
 *	(control), "bulk", "int" (interrupt), or "iso" (isochronous).
 *	For example usb_sndbulkpipe() or usb_rcvintpipe().  Endpoint
 *	numbers range from zero to fifteen.  Note that "in" endpoint two
 *	is a different endpoint (and pipe) from "out" endpoint two.
 *	The current configuration controls the existence, type, and
 *	maximum packet size of any given endpoint.
 * @stream_id: the endpoint's stream ID for bulk streams
 * @dev: Identifies the USB device to perform the request.
 * @status: This is read in non-iso completion functions to get the
 *	status of the particular request.  ISO requests only use it
 *	to tell whether the URB was unlinked; detailed status for
 *	each frame is in the fields of the iso_frame-desc.
 * @transfer_flags: A variety of flags may be used to affect how URB
 *	submission, unlinking, or operation are handled.  Different
 *	kinds of URB can use different flags.
 * @transfer_buffer:  This identifies the buffer to (or from) which the I/O
 *	request will be performed unless URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP is set
 *	(however, do not leave garbage in transfer_buffer even then).
 *	This buffer must be suitable for DMA; allocate it with
 *	kmalloc() or equivalent.  For transfers to "in" endpoints, contents
 *	of this buffer will be modified.  This buffer is used for the data
 *	stage of control transfers.
 * @transfer_dma: When transfer_flags includes URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP,
 *	the device driver is saying that it provided this DMA address,
 *	which the host controller driver should use in preference to the
 *	transfer_buffer.
 * @sg: scatter gather buffer list, the buffer size of each element in
 * 	the list (except the last) must be divisible by the endpoint's
 * 	max packet size if no_sg_constraint isn't set in 'struct usb_bus'
 * @num_mapped_sgs: (internal) number of mapped sg entries
 * @num_sgs: number of entries in the sg list
 * @transfer_buffer_length: How big is transfer_buffer.  The transfer may
 *	be broken up into chunks according to the current maximum packet
 *	size for the endpoint, which is a function of the configuration
 *	and is encoded in the pipe.  When the length is zero, neither
 *	transfer_buffer nor transfer_dma is used.
 * @actual_length: This is read in non-iso completion functions, and
 *	it tells how many bytes (out of transfer_buffer_length) were
 *	transferred.  It will normally be the same as requested, unless
 *	either an error was reported or a short read was performed.
 *	The URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag may be used to make such
 *	short reads be reported as errors.
 * @setup_packet: Only used for control transfers, this points to eight bytes
 *	of setup data.  Control transfers always start by sending this data
 *	to the device.  Then transfer_buffer is read or written, if needed.
 * @setup_dma: DMA pointer for the setup packet.  The caller must not use
 *	this field; setup_packet must point to a valid buffer.
 * @start_frame: Returns the initial frame for isochronous transfers.
 * @number_of_packets: Lists the number of ISO transfer buffers.
 * @interval: Specifies the polling interval for interrupt or isochronous
 *	transfers.  The units are frames (milliseconds) for full and low
 *	speed devices, and microframes (1/8 millisecond) for highspeed
 *	and SuperSpeed devices.
 * @error_count: Returns the number of ISO transfers that reported errors.
 * @context: For use in completion functions.  This normally points to
 *	request-specific driver context.
 * @complete: Completion handler. This URB is passed as the parameter to the
 *	completion function.  The completion function may then do what
 *	it likes with the URB, including resubmitting or freeing it.
 * @iso_frame_desc: Used to provide arrays of ISO transfer buffers and to
 *	collect the transfer status for each buffer.
 *
 * This structure identifies USB transfer requests.  URBs must be allocated by
 * calling usb_alloc_urb() and freed with a call to usb_free_urb().
 * Initialization may be done using various usb_fill_*_urb() functions.  URBs
 * are submitted using usb_submit_urb(), and pending requests may be canceled
 * using usb_unlink_urb() or usb_kill_urb().
 *
 * Data Transfer Buffers:
 *
 * Normally drivers provide I/O buffers allocated with kmalloc() or otherwise
 * taken from the general page pool.  That is provided by transfer_buffer
 * (control requests also use setup_packet), and host controller drivers
 * perform a dma mapping (and unmapping) for each buffer transferred.  Those
 * mapping operations can be expensive on some platforms (perhaps using a dma
 * bounce buffer or talking to an IOMMU),
 * although they're cheap on commodity x86 and ppc hardware.
 *
 * Alternatively, drivers may pass the URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP transfer flag,
 * which tells the host controller driver that no such mapping is needed for
 * the transfer_buffer since
 * the device driver is DMA-aware.  For example, a device driver might
 * allocate a DMA buffer with usb_alloc_coherent() or call usb_buffer_map().
 * When this transfer flag is provided, host controller drivers will
 * attempt to use the dma address found in the transfer_dma
 * field rather than determining a dma address themselves.
 *
 * Note that transfer_buffer must still be set if the controller
 * does not support DMA (as indicated by hcd_uses_dma()) and when talking
 * to root hub. If you have to trasfer between highmem zone and the device
 * on such controller, create a bounce buffer or bail out with an error.
 * If transfer_buffer cannot be set (is in highmem) and the controller is DMA
 * capable, assign NULL to it, so that usbmon knows not to use the value.
 * The setup_packet must always be set, so it cannot be located in highmem.
 *
 * Initialization:
 *
 * All URBs submitted must initialize the dev, pipe, transfer_flags (may be
 * zero), and complete fields.  All URBs must also initialize
 * transfer_buffer and transfer_buffer_length.  They may provide the
 * URB_SHORT_NOT_OK transfer flag, indicating that short reads are
 * to be treated as errors; that flag is invalid for write requests.
 *
 * Bulk URBs may
 * use the URB_ZERO_PACKET transfer flag, indicating that bulk OUT transfers
 * should always terminate with a short packet, even if it means adding an
 * extra zero length packet.
 *
 * Control URBs must provide a valid pointer in the setup_packet field.
 * Unlike the transfer_buffer, the setup_packet may not be mapped for DMA
 * beforehand.
 *
 * Interrupt URBs must provide an interval, saying how often (in milliseconds
 * or, for highspeed devices, 125 microsecond units)
 * to poll for transfers.  After the URB has been submitted, the interval
 * field reflects how the transfer was actually scheduled.
 * The polling interval may be more frequent than requested.
 * For example, some controllers have a maximum interval of 32 milliseconds,
 * while others support intervals of up to 1024 milliseconds.
 * Isochronous URBs also have transfer intervals.  (Note that for isochronous
 * endpoints, as well as high speed interrupt endpoints, the encoding of
 * the transfer interval in the endpoint descriptor is logarithmic.
 * Device drivers must convert that value to linear units themselves.)
 *
 * If an isochronous endpoint queue isn't already running, the host
 * controller will schedule a new URB to start as soon as bandwidth
 * utilization allows.  If the queue is running then a new URB will be
 * scheduled to start in the first transfer slot following the end of the
 * preceding URB, if that slot has not already expired.  If the slot has
 * expired (which can happen when IRQ delivery is delayed for a long time),
 * the scheduling behavior depends on the URB_ISO_ASAP flag.  If the flag
 * is clear then the URB will be scheduled to start in the expired slot,
 * implying that some of its packets will not be transferred; if the flag
 * is set then the URB will be scheduled in the first unexpired slot,
 * breaking the queue's synchronization.  Upon URB completion, the
 * start_frame field will be set to the (micro)frame number in which the
 * transfer was scheduled.  Ranges for frame counter values are HC-specific
 * and can go from as low as 256 to as high as 65536 frames.
 *
 * Isochronous URBs have a different data transfer model, in part because
 * the quality of service is only "best effort".  Callers provide specially
 * allocated URBs, with number_of_packets worth of iso_frame_desc structures
 * at the end.  Each such packet is an individual ISO transfer.  Isochronous
 * URBs are normally queued, submitted by drivers to arrange that
 * transfers are at least double buffered, and then explicitly resubmitted
 * in completion handlers, so
 * that data (such as audio or video) streams at as constant a rate as the
 * host controller scheduler can support.
 *
 * Completion Callbacks:
 *
 * The completion callback is made in_interrupt(), and one of the first
 * things that a completion handler should do is check the status field.
 * The status field is provided for all URBs.  It is used to report
 * unlinked URBs, and status for all non-ISO transfers.  It should not
 * be examined before the URB is returned to the completion handler.
 *
 * The context field is normally used to link URBs back to the relevant
 * driver or request state.
 *
 * When the completion callback is invoked for non-isochronous URBs, the
 * actual_length field tells how many bytes were transferred.  This field
 * is updated even when the URB terminated with an error or was unlinked.
 *
 * ISO transfer status is reported in the status and actual_length fields
 * of the iso_frame_desc array, and the number of errors is reported in
 * error_count.  Completion callbacks for ISO transfers will normally
 * (re)submit URBs to ensure a constant transfer rate.
 *
 * Note that even fields marked "public" should not be touched by the driver
 * when the urb is owned by the hcd, that is, since the call to
 * usb_submit_urb() till the entry into the completion routine.
