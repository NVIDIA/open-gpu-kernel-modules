/**
 * union security_list_options - Linux Security Module hook function list
 *
 * Security hooks for program execution operations.
 *
 * @bprm_creds_for_exec:
 *	If the setup in prepare_exec_creds did not setup @bprm->cred->security
 *	properly for executing @bprm->file, update the LSM's portion of
 *	@bprm->cred->security to be what commit_creds needs to install for the
 *	new program.  This hook may also optionally check permissions
 *	(e.g. for transitions between security domains).
 *	The hook must set @bprm->secureexec to 1 if AT_SECURE should be set to
 *	request libc enable secure mode.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
 * @bprm_creds_from_file:
 *	If @file is setpcap, suid, sgid or otherwise marked to change
 *	privilege upon exec, update @bprm->cred to reflect that change.
 *	This is called after finding the binary that will be executed.
 *	without an interpreter.  This ensures that the credentials will not
 *	be derived from a script that the binary will need to reopen, which
 *	when reopend may end up being a completely different file.  This
 *	hook may also optionally check permissions (e.g. for transitions
 *	between security domains).
 *	The hook must set @bprm->secureexec to 1 if AT_SECURE should be set to
 *	request libc enable secure mode.
 *	The hook must add to @bprm->per_clear any personality flags that
 * 	should be cleared from current->personality.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
 * @bprm_check_security:
 *	This hook mediates the point when a search for a binary handler will
 *	begin.  It allows a check against the @bprm->cred->security value
 *	which was set in the preceding creds_for_exec call.  The argv list and
 *	envp list are reliably available in @bprm.  This hook may be called
 *	multiple times during a single execve.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.
 * @bprm_committing_creds:
 *	Prepare to install the new security attributes of a process being
 *	transformed by an execve operation, based on the old credentials
 *	pointed to by @current->cred and the information set in @bprm->cred by
 *	the bprm_creds_for_exec hook.  @bprm points to the linux_binprm
 *	structure.  This hook is a good place to perform state changes on the
 *	process such as closing open file descriptors to which access will no
 *	longer be granted when the attributes are changed.  This is called
 *	immediately before commit_creds().
 * @bprm_committed_creds:
 *	Tidy up after the installation of the new security attributes of a
 *	process being transformed by an execve operation.  The new credentials
 *	have, by this point, been set to @current->cred.  @bprm points to the
 *	linux_binprm structure.  This hook is a good place to perform state
 *	changes on the process such as clearing out non-inheritable signal
 *	state.  This is called immediately after commit_creds().
 *
 * Security hooks for mount using fs_context.
 *	[See also Documentation/filesystems/mount_api.rst]
 *
 * @fs_context_dup:
 *	Allocate and attach a security structure to sc->security.  This pointer
 *	is initialised to NULL by the caller.
 *	@fc indicates the new filesystem context.
 *	@src_fc indicates the original filesystem context.
 * @fs_context_parse_param:
 *	Userspace provided a parameter to configure a superblock.  The LSM may
 *	reject it with an error and may use it for itself, in which case it
 *	should return 0; otherwise it should return -ENOPARAM to pass it on to
 *	the filesystem.
 *	@fc indicates the filesystem context.
 *	@param The parameter
 *
 * Security hooks for filesystem operations.
 *
 * @sb_alloc_security:
 *	Allocate and attach a security structure to the sb->s_security field.

 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @sb_mount:
 *	Check permission before an object specified by @dev_name is mounted on
 *	the mount point named by @nd.  For an ordinary mount, @dev_name
 *	identifies a device if the file system type requires a device.  For a
 *	remount (@flags & MS_REMOUNT), @dev_name is irrelevant.  For a
 *	loopback/bind mount (@flags & MS_BIND), @dev_name identifies the
 *	pathname of the object being mounted.

 *	@type contains the filesystem type.
 *	@flags contains the mount flags.
 *	@data contains the filesystem-specific data.

 * @sb_copy_data:
 *	Allow mount option data to be copied prior to parsing by the filesystem,
 *	so that the security module can extract security-specific mount
 *	options cleanly (a filesystem may modify the data e.g. with strsep()).
 *	This also allows the original mount data to be stripped of security-
 *	specific options to avoid having to make filesystems aware of them.
 *	@orig the original mount data copied from userspace.
 *	@copy copied data which will be passed to the security module.
 *	Returns 0 if the copy was successful.
 * @sb_mnt_opts_compat:

 * @sb_umount:
 *	Check permission before the @mnt file system is unmounted.
 *	@mnt contains the mounted file system.
 *	@flags contains the unmount flags, e.g. MNT_FORCE.

 *	@oldsb old superblock which contain information to clone
 *	@newsb new superblock which needs filled in
 * @sb_add_mnt_opt:
 * 	Add one mount @option to @mnt_opts.
 * @sb_parse_opts_str:
 *	Parse a string of security data filling in the opts structure
 *	@options string containing all mount options known by the LSM
 *	@opts binary data structure usable by the LSM
 * @move_mount:
 *	Check permission before a mount is moved.
 *	@from_path indicates the mount that is going to be moved.
 *	@to_path indicates the mountpoint that will be mounted upon.
 * @dentry_init_security:
 *	Compute a context for a dentry as the inode is not yet available
 *	since NFSv4 has no label backed by an EA anyway.
 *	@dentry dentry to use in calculating the context.
 *	@mode mode used to determine resource type.
 *	@name name of the last path component used to create file
 *	@ctx pointer to place the pointer to the resulting context in.
 *	@ctxlen point to place the length of the resulting context.
 * @dentry_create_files_as:
 *	Compute a context for a dentry as the inode is not yet available
 *	and set that context in passed in creds so that new files are
 *	created using that context. Context is calculated using the
 *	passed in creds and not the creds of the caller.
 *	@dentry dentry to use in calculating the context.
 *	@mode mode used to determine resource type.
 *	@name name of the last path component used to create file

 *
 * Security hooks for inode operations.
 *

 *	allocated.
 *	@inode contains the inode structure.
 *	Return 0 if operation was successful.
 * @inode_free_security:
 *	@inode contains the inode structure.
 *	Deallocate the inode security structure and set @inode->i_security to
 *	NULL.
 * @inode_init_security:
 *	Obtain the security attribute name suffix and value to set on a newly
 *	created inode and set up the incore security field for the new inode.
 *	This hook is called by the fs code as part of the inode creation
 *	transaction and provides for atomic labeling of the inode, unlike
 *	the post_create/mkdir/... hooks called by the VFS.  The hook function
 *	is expected to allocate the name and value via kmalloc, with the caller
 *	being responsible for calling kfree after using them.
 *	If the security module does not use security attributes or does
 *	not wish to put a security attribute on this particular inode,
 *	then it should return -EOPNOTSUPP to skip this processing.

 *	-EOPNOTSUPP if no security attribute is needed, or
 *	-ENOMEM on memory allocation failure.

 *
 * Security hooks for file operations
 *
 * @file_permission:
 *	Check file permissions before accessing an open file.  This hook is
 *	called by various operations that read or write files.  A security
 *	module can use this hook to perform additional checking on these
 *	operations, e.g.  to revalidate permissions on use to support privilege
 *	bracketing or policy changes.  Notice that this hook is used when the
 *	actual read/write operations are performed, whereas the
 *	inode_security_ops hook is called when a file is opened (as well as
 *	many other operations).
 *	Caveat:  Although this hook can be used to revalidate permissions for
 *	various system call operations that read or write files, it does not
 *	address the revalidation of permissions for memory-mapped files.

 *	should never be used by the security module.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.

 *	Check permissions for a mmap operation at @addr.
 *	@addr contains virtual address that will be used for the operation.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.

 *	never be used by the security module.
 *	@file contains the file structure.
 *	@cmd contains the operation to be performed.
 *	@arg contains the operational arguments.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
