/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * mac80211 is the Linux stack for 802.11 hardware that implements
 * only partial functionality in hard- or firmware. This document
 * defines the interface between mac80211 and low-level hardware
 * drivers.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Calling mac80211 from interrupts
 *
 * Only ieee80211_tx_status_irqsafe() and ieee80211_rx_irqsafe() can be
 * called in hardware interrupt context. The low-level driver must not call any
 * other functions in hardware interrupt context. If there is a need for such
 * call, the low-level driver should first ACK the interrupt and perform the
 * IEEE 802.11 code call after this, e.g. from a scheduled workqueue or even
 * tasklet function.
 *
 * NOTE: If the driver opts to use the _irqsafe() functions, it may not also
 *	 use the non-IRQ-safe functions!
 */

/**
 * DOC: Warning
 *
 * If you're reading this document and not the header file itself, it will
 * be incomplete because not all documentation has been converted yet.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame format
 *
 * As a general rule, when frames are passed between mac80211 and the driver,
 * they start with the IEEE 802.11 header and include the same octets that are
 * sent over the air except for the FCS which should be calculated by the
 * hardware.
 *
 * There are, however, various exceptions to this rule for advanced features:
 *
 * The first exception is for hardware encryption and decryption offload
 * where the IV/ICV may or may not be generated in hardware.
 *
 * Secondly, when the hardware handles fragmentation, the frame handed to
 * the driver from mac80211 is the MSDU, not the MPDU.
 */

/**
 * DOC: mac80211 workqueue
 *
 * mac80211 provides its own workqueue for drivers and internal mac80211 use.
 * The workqueue is a single threaded workqueue and can only be accessed by
 * helpers for sanity checking. Drivers must ensure all work added onto the
 * mac80211 workqueue should be cancelled on the driver stop() callback.
 *
 * mac80211 will flushed the workqueue upon interface removal and during
 * suspend.
 *
 * All work performed on the mac80211 workqueue must not acquire the RTNL lock.
 *
 */

/**
 * DOC: mac80211 software tx queueing
 *
 * mac80211 provides an optional intermediate queueing implementation designed
 * to allow the driver to keep hardware queues short and provide some fairness
 * between different stations/interfaces.
 * In this model, the driver pulls data frames from the mac80211 queue instead
 * of letting mac80211 push them via drv_tx().
 * Other frames (e.g. control or management) are still pushed using drv_tx().
 *
 * Drivers indicate that they use this model by implementing the .wake_tx_queue
 * driver operation.
 *
 * Intermediate queues (struct ieee80211_txq) are kept per-sta per-tid, with
 * another per-sta for non-data/non-mgmt and bufferable management frames, and
 * a single per-vif queue for multicast data frames.
 *
 * The driver is expected to initialize its private per-queue data for stations
 * and interfaces in the .add_interface and .sta_add ops.
 *
 * The driver can't access the queue directly. To dequeue a frame from a
 * txq, it calls ieee80211_tx_dequeue(). Whenever mac80211 adds a new frame to a
 * queue, it calls the .wake_tx_queue driver op.
 *
 * Drivers can optionally delegate responsibility for scheduling queues to
 * mac80211, to take advantage of airtime fairness accounting. In this case, to
 * obtain the next queue to pull frames from, the driver calls
 * ieee80211_next_txq(). The driver is then expected to return the txq using
 * ieee80211_return_txq().
 *
 * For AP powersave TIM handling, the driver only needs to indicate if it has
 * buffered packets in the driver specific data structures by calling
 * ieee80211_sta_set_buffered(). For frames buffered in the ieee80211_txq
 * struct, mac80211 sets the appropriate TIM PVB bits and calls
 * .release_buffered_frames().
 * In that callback the driver is therefore expected to release its own
 * buffered frames and afterwards also frames from the ieee80211_txq (obtained
 * via the usual ieee80211_tx_dequeue).

/**
 * enum mac80211_tx_info_flags - flags to describe transmission information/status
 *
 * These flags are used with the @flags member of &ieee80211_tx_info.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_REQ_TX_STATUS: require TX status callback for this frame.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_ASSIGN_SEQ: The driver has to assign a sequence
 *	number to this frame, taking care of not overwriting the fragment
 *	number and increasing the sequence number only when the
 *	IEEE80211_TX_CTL_FIRST_FRAGMENT flag is set. mac80211 will properly
 *	assign sequence numbers to QoS-data frames but cannot do so correctly
 *	for non-QoS-data and management frames because beacons need them from
 *	that counter as well and mac80211 cannot guarantee proper sequencing.
 *	If this flag is set, the driver should instruct the hardware to
 *	assign a sequence number to the frame or assign one itself. Cf. IEEE
 *	802.11-2007 7.1.3.4.1 paragraph 3. This flag will always be set for
 *	beacons and always be clear for frames without a sequence number field.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_ACK: tell the low level not to wait for an ack
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_CLEAR_PS_FILT: clear powersave filter for destination
 *	station
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_FIRST_FRAGMENT: this is a first fragment of the frame
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_SEND_AFTER_DTIM: send this frame after DTIM beacon
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_AMPDU: this frame should be sent as part of an A-MPDU
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_INJECTED: Frame was injected, internal to mac80211.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STAT_TX_FILTERED: The frame was not transmitted
 *	because the destination STA was in powersave mode. Note that to
 *	avoid race conditions, the filter must be set by the hardware or
 *	firmware upon receiving a frame that indicates that the station
 *	went to sleep (must be done on device to filter frames already on
 *	the queue) and may only be unset after mac80211 gives the OK for
 *	that by setting the IEEE80211_TX_CTL_CLEAR_PS_FILT (see above),
 *	since only then is it guaranteed that no more frames are in the
 *	hardware queue.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STAT_ACK: Frame was acknowledged
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STAT_AMPDU: The frame was aggregated, so status
 * 	is for the whole aggregation.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STAT_AMPDU_NO_BACK: no block ack was returned,
 * 	so consider using block ack request (BAR).
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_RATE_CTRL_PROBE: internal to mac80211, can be
 *	set by rate control algorithms to indicate probe rate, will
 *	be cleared for fragmented frames (except on the last fragment)
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_OFFCHAN_TX_OK: Internal to mac80211. Used to indicate
 *	that a frame can be transmitted while the queues are stopped for
 *	off-channel operation.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_HW_80211_ENCAP: This frame uses hardware encapsulation
 *	(header conversion)
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_RETRIED: completely internal to mac80211,
 *	used to indicate that a frame was already retried due to PS
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_DONT_ENCRYPT: completely internal to mac80211,
 *	used to indicate frame should not be encrypted
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_PS_BUFFER: This frame is a response to a poll
 *	frame (PS-Poll or uAPSD) or a non-bufferable MMPDU and must
 *	be sent although the station is in powersave mode.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_MORE_FRAMES: More frames will be passed to the
 *	transmit function after the current frame, this can be used
 *	by drivers to kick the DMA queue only if unset or when the
 *	queue gets full.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_RETRANSMISSION: This frame is being retransmitted
 *	after TX status because the destination was asleep, it must not
 *	be modified again (no seqno assignment, crypto, etc.)
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_MLME_CONN_TX: This frame was transmitted by the MLME
 *	code for connection establishment, this indicates that its status
 *	should kick the MLME state machine.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_NL80211_FRAME_TX: Frame was requested through nl80211
 *	MLME command (internal to mac80211 to figure out whether to send TX
 *	status to user space)
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_LDPC: tells the driver to use LDPC for this frame
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_STBC: Enables Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) for this
 *	frame and selects the maximum number of streams that it can use.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_TX_OFFCHAN: Marks this packet to be transmitted on
 *	the off-channel channel when a remain-on-channel offload is done
 *	in hardware -- normal packets still flow and are expected to be
 *	handled properly by the device.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_INTFL_TKIP_MIC_FAILURE: Marks this packet to be used for TKIP
 *	testing. It will be sent out with incorrect Michael MIC key to allow
 *	TKIP countermeasures to be tested.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_CCK_RATE: This frame will be sent at non CCK rate.
 *	This flag is actually used for management frame especially for P2P
 *	frames not being sent at CCK rate in 2GHz band.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP: This packet marks the end of service period,
 *	when its status is reported the service period ends. For frames in
 *	an SP that mac80211 transmits, it is already set; for driver frames
 *	the driver may set this flag. It is also used to do the same for
 *	PS-Poll responses.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_USE_MINRATE: This frame will be sent at lowest rate.
 *	This flag is used to send nullfunc frame at minimum rate when
 *	the nullfunc is used for connection monitoring purpose.
 * @IEEE80211_TX_CTL_DONTFRAG: Don't fragment this packet even if it
 *	would be fragmented by size (this is optional, only used for
 *	monitor injection).
 * @IEEE80211_TX_STAT_NOACK_TRANSMITTED: A frame that was marked with
 *	IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_ACK has been successfully transmitted without
 *	any errors (like issues specific to the driver/HW).
 *	This flag must not be set for frames that don't request no-ack
 *	behaviour with IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_ACK.
 *
 * Note: If you have to add new flags to the enumeration, then don't
 *	 forget to update %IEEE80211_TX_TEMPORARY_FLAGS when necessary.

/**
 * enum mac80211_rx_flags - receive flags
 *
 * These flags are used with the @flag member of &struct ieee80211_rx_status.
 * @RX_FLAG_MMIC_ERROR: Michael MIC error was reported on this frame.
 *	Use together with %RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED.
 * @RX_FLAG_DECRYPTED: This frame was decrypted in hardware.
 * @RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED: the Michael MIC is stripped off this frame,
 *	verification has been done by the hardware.
 * @RX_FLAG_IV_STRIPPED: The IV and ICV are stripped from this frame.
 *	If this flag is set, the stack cannot do any replay detection
 *	hence the driver or hardware will have to do that.
 * @RX_FLAG_PN_VALIDATED: Currently only valid for CCMP/GCMP frames, this
 *	flag indicates that the PN was verified for replay protection.
 *	Note that this flag is also currently only supported when a frame
 *	is also decrypted (ie. @RX_FLAG_DECRYPTED must be set)
 * @RX_FLAG_DUP_VALIDATED: The driver should set this flag if it did
 *	de-duplication by itself.
 * @RX_FLAG_FAILED_FCS_CRC: Set this flag if the FCS check failed on
 *	the frame.
 * @RX_FLAG_FAILED_PLCP_CRC: Set this flag if the PCLP check failed on
 *	the frame.
 * @RX_FLAG_MACTIME_START: The timestamp passed in the RX status (@mactime
 *	field) is valid and contains the time the first symbol of the MPDU
 *	was received. This is useful in monitor mode and for proper IBSS
 *	merging.
 * @RX_FLAG_MACTIME_END: The timestamp passed in the RX status (@mactime
 *	field) is valid and contains the time the last symbol of the MPDU
 *	(including FCS) was received.
 * @RX_FLAG_MACTIME_PLCP_START: The timestamp passed in the RX status (@mactime
 *	field) is valid and contains the time the SYNC preamble was received.
 * @RX_FLAG_NO_SIGNAL_VAL: The signal strength value is not present.
 *	Valid only for data frames (mainly A-MPDU)
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DETAILS: A-MPDU details are known, in particular the reference
 *	number (@ampdu_reference) must be populated and be a distinct number for
 *	each A-MPDU
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_LAST_KNOWN: last subframe is known, should be set on all
 *	subframes of a single A-MPDU
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_IS_LAST: this subframe is the last subframe of the A-MPDU
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_ERROR: A delimiter CRC error has been detected
 *	on this subframe
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_KNOWN: The delimiter CRC field is known (the CRC
 *	is stored in the @ampdu_delimiter_crc field)
 * @RX_FLAG_MIC_STRIPPED: The mic was stripped of this packet. Decryption was
 *	done by the hardware
 * @RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR: Report frame only to monitor interfaces without
 *	processing it in any regular way.
 *	This is useful if drivers offload some frames but still want to report
 *	them for sniffing purposes.
 * @RX_FLAG_SKIP_MONITOR: Process and report frame to all interfaces except
 *	monitor interfaces.
 *	This is useful if drivers offload some frames but still want to report
 *	them for sniffing purposes.
 * @RX_FLAG_AMSDU_MORE: Some drivers may prefer to report separate A-MSDU
 *	subframes instead of a one huge frame for performance reasons.
 *	All, but the last MSDU from an A-MSDU should have this flag set. E.g.
 *	if an A-MSDU has 3 frames, the first 2 must have the flag set, while
 *	the 3rd (last) one must not have this flag set. The flag is used to
 *	deal with retransmission/duplication recovery properly since A-MSDU
 *	subframes share the same sequence number. Reported subframes can be
 *	either regular MSDU or singly A-MSDUs. Subframes must not be
 *	interleaved with other frames.
 * @RX_FLAG_RADIOTAP_VENDOR_DATA: This frame contains vendor-specific
 *	radiotap data in the skb->data (before the frame) as described by
 *	the &struct ieee80211_vendor_radiotap.
 * @RX_FLAG_ALLOW_SAME_PN: Allow the same PN as same packet before.
 *	This is used for AMSDU subframes which can have the same PN as
 *	the first subframe.
 * @RX_FLAG_ICV_STRIPPED: The ICV is stripped from this frame. CRC checking must
 *	be done in the hardware.
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_EOF_BIT: Value of the EOF bit in the A-MPDU delimiter for this
 *	frame
 * @RX_FLAG_AMPDU_EOF_BIT_KNOWN: The EOF value is known
 * @RX_FLAG_RADIOTAP_HE: HE radiotap data is present
 *	(&struct ieee80211_radiotap_he, mac80211 will fill in

 *	in &struct ieee80211_rx_status.  Note that if this value isn't

 *	or the BSS we're associated to
 * @addr: address of this interface
 * @p2p: indicates whether this AP or STA interface is a p2p
 *	interface, i.e. a GO or p2p-sta respectively
 * @csa_active: marks whether a channel switch is going on. Internally it is
 *	write-protected by sdata_lock and local->mtx so holding either is fine
 *	for read access.
 * @mu_mimo_owner: indicates interface owns MU-MIMO capability
 * @driver_flags: flags/capabilities the driver has for this interface,
 *	these need to be set (or cleared) when the interface is added
 *	or, if supported by the driver, the interface type is changed
 *	at runtime, mac80211 will never touch this field
 * @offloaad_flags: hardware offload capabilities/flags for this interface.
 *	These are initialized by mac80211 before calling .add_interface,
 *	.change_interface or .update_vif_offload and updated by the driver
 *	within these ops, based on supported features or runtime change
 *	restrictions.

 * @cab_queue: content-after-beacon (DTIM beacon really) queue, AP mode only
 * @chanctx_conf: The channel context this interface is assigned to, or %NULL
 *	when it is not assigned. This pointer is RCU-protected due to the TX
 *	path needing to access it; even though the netdev carrier will always
 *	be off when it is %NULL there can still be races and packets could be
 *	processed after it switches back to %NULL.
 * @debugfs_dir: debugfs dentry, can be used by drivers to create own per
 *	interface debug files. Note that it will be NULL for the virtual
 *	monitor interface (if that is requested.)
 * @probe_req_reg: probe requests should be reported to mac80211 for this

 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV: This flag should be set by the

 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_MMIC: This flag should be set by

 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PAIRWISE: Set by mac80211, this flag indicates
 *	that the key is pairwise rather then a shared key.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX: This flag should be set by the driver for a
 *	CCMP/GCMP key if it requires CCMP/GCMP encryption of management frames
 *	(MFP) to be done in software.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PUT_IV_SPACE: This flag should be set by the driver
 *	if space should be prepared for the IV, but the IV
 *	itself should not be generated. Do not set together with
 *	@IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV on the same key. Setting this flag does
 *	not necessarily mean that SKBs will have sufficient tailroom for ICV or

 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_RX_MGMT: This key will be used to decrypt received
 *	management frames. The flag can help drivers that have a hardware
 *	crypto implementation that doesn't deal with management frames
 *	properly by allowing them to not upload the keys to hardware and
 *	fall back to software crypto. Note that this flag deals only with
 *	RX, if your crypto engine can't deal with TX you can also set the
 *	%IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX flag to encrypt such frames in SW.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV_MGMT: This flag should be set by the

 *	only for management frames (MFP).
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_RESERVE_TAILROOM: This flag should be set by the

 *	be reserved for ICV or MIC, even when HW encryption is enabled.
 * @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_PUT_MIC_SPACE: This flag should be set by the driver for

 *	@use_cts_prot for G/N protection, @use_short_slot for slot

 *	Some wireless LAN chipsets buffer broadcast/multicast frames

 * @IEEE80211_HW_AMPDU_AGGREGATION:
 *	Hardware supports 11n A-MPDU aggregation.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS:
 *	Hardware has power save support (i.e. can go to sleep).
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK:
 *	Hardware requires nullfunc frame handling in stack, implies
 *	stack support for dynamic PS.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS:
 *	Hardware has support for dynamic PS.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_MFP_CAPABLE:
 *	Hardware supports management frame protection (MFP, IEEE 802.11w).
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS:
 *	Hardware can provide ack status reports of Tx frames to
 *	the stack.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_CONNECTION_MONITOR:
 *	The hardware performs its own connection monitoring, including
 *	periodic keep-alives to the AP and probing the AP on beacon loss.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_NEED_DTIM_BEFORE_ASSOC:
 *	This device needs to get data from beacon before association (i.e.
 *	dtim_period).
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PER_STA_GTK: The device's crypto engine supports
 *	per-station GTKs as used by IBSS RSN or during fast transition. If
 *	the device doesn't support per-station GTKs, but can be asked not
 *	to decrypt group addressed frames, then IBSS RSN support is still
 *	possible but software crypto will be used. Advertise the wiphy flag
 *	only in that case.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS: When operating in AP mode the device
 *	autonomously manages the PS status of connected stations. When
 *	this flag is set mac80211 will not trigger PS mode for connected
 *	stations based on the PM bit of incoming frames.
 *	Use ieee80211_start_ps()/ieee8021_end_ps() to manually configure
 *	the PS mode of connected stations.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TX_AMPDU_SETUP_IN_HW: The device handles TX A-MPDU session
 *	setup strictly in HW. mac80211 should not attempt to do this in
 *	software.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_WANT_MONITOR_VIF: The driver would like to be informed of
 *	a virtual monitor interface when monitor interfaces are the only
 *	active interfaces.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_NO_AUTO_VIF: The driver would like for no wlanX to
 *	be created.  It is expected user-space will create vifs as
 *	desired (and thus have them named as desired).
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL: The driver wants to control which of the
 *	crypto algorithms can be done in software - so don't automatically
 *	try to fall back to it if hardware crypto fails, but do so only if
 *	the driver returns 1. This also forces the driver to advertise its
 *	supported cipher suites.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORT_FAST_XMIT: The driver/hardware supports fast-xmit,
 *	this currently requires only the ability to calculate the duration
 *	for frames.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL: The driver wants to control per-interface
 *	queue mapping in order to use different queues (not just one per AC)
 *	for different virtual interfaces. See the doc section on HW queue
 *	control for more details.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_RC_TABLE: The driver supports using a rate
 *	selection table provided by the rate control algorithm.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_P2P_DEV_ADDR_FOR_INTF: Use the P2P Device address for any
 *	P2P Interface. This will be honoured even if more than one interface
 *	is supported.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TIMING_BEACON_ONLY: Use sync timing from beacon frames
 *	only, to allow getting TBTT of a DTIM beacon.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_HT_CCK_RATES: Hardware supports mixing HT/CCK rates
 *	and can cope with CCK rates in an aggregation session (e.g. by not
 *	using aggregation for such frames.)
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_CHANCTX_STA_CSA: Support 802.11h based channel-switch (CSA)
 *	for a single active channel while using channel contexts. When support
 *	is not enabled the default action is to disconnect when getting the
 *	CSA frame.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CLONED_SKBS: The driver will never modify the payload
 *	or tailroom of TX skbs without copying them first.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SINGLE_SCAN_ON_ALL_BANDS: The HW supports scanning on all bands
 *	in one command, mac80211 doesn't have to run separate scans per band.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TDLS_WIDER_BW: The device/driver supports wider bandwidth
 *	than then BSS bandwidth for a TDLS link on the base channel.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_AMSDU_IN_AMPDU: The driver supports receiving A-MSDUs
 *	within A-MPDU.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_BEACON_TX_STATUS: The device/driver provides TX status
 *	for sent beacons.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_NEEDS_UNIQUE_STA_ADDR: Hardware (or driver) requires that each
 *	station has a unique address, i.e. each station entry can be identified
 *	by just its MAC address; this prevents, for example, the same station
 *	from connecting to two virtual AP interfaces at the same time.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_REORDERING_BUFFER: Hardware (or driver) manages the
 *	reordering buffer internally, guaranteeing mac80211 receives frames in
 *	order and does not need to manage its own reorder buffer or BA session
 *	timeout.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_USES_RSS: The device uses RSS and thus requires parallel RX,
 *	which implies using per-CPU station statistics.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TX_AMSDU: Hardware (or driver) supports software aggregated
 *	A-MSDU frames. Requires software tx queueing and fast-xmit support.
 *	When not using minstrel/minstrel_ht rate control, the driver must
 *	limit the maximum A-MSDU size based on the current tx rate by setting
 *	max_rc_amsdu_len in struct ieee80211_sta.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TX_FRAG_LIST: Hardware (or driver) supports sending frag_list
 *	skbs, needed for zero-copy software A-MSDU.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_LOW_ACK: The driver (or firmware) reports low ack event
 *	by ieee80211_report_low_ack() based on its own algorithm. For such
 *	drivers, mac80211 packet loss mechanism will not be triggered and driver
 *	is completely depending on firmware event for station kickout.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_FRAG: Hardware does fragmentation by itself.
 *	The stack will not do fragmentation.
 *	The callback for @set_frag_threshold should be set as well.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TDLS_BUFFER_STA: Hardware supports buffer STA on
 *	TDLS links.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_DEAUTH_NEED_MGD_TX_PREP: The driver requires the
 *	mgd_prepare_tx() callback to be called before transmission of a
 *	deauthentication frame in case the association was completed but no
 *	beacon was heard. This is required in multi-channel scenarios, where the
 *	virtual interface might not be given air time for the transmission of
 *	the frame, as it is not synced with the AP/P2P GO yet, and thus the
 *	deauthentication frame might not be transmitted.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_DOESNT_SUPPORT_QOS_NDP: The driver (or firmware) doesn't
 *	support QoS NDP for AP probing - that's most likely a driver bug.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_BUFF_MMPDU_TXQ: use the TXQ for bufferable MMPDUs, this of
 *	course requires the driver to use TXQs to start with.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_VHT_EXT_NSS_BW: (Hardware) rate control supports VHT
 *	extended NSS BW (dot11VHTExtendedNSSBWCapable). This flag will be set if
 *	the selected rate control algorithm sets %RATE_CTRL_CAPA_VHT_EXT_NSS_BW
 *	but if the rate control is built-in then it must be set by the driver.
 *	See also the documentation for that flag.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_STA_MMPDU_TXQ: use the extra non-TID per-station TXQ for all
 *	MMPDUs on station interfaces. This of course requires the driver to use
 *	TXQs to start with.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TX_STATUS_NO_AMPDU_LEN: Driver does not report accurate A-MPDU
 *	length in tx status information
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_MULTI_BSSID: Hardware supports multi BSSID
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_ONLY_HE_MULTI_BSSID: Hardware supports multi BSSID
 *	only for HE APs. Applies if @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_MULTI_BSSID is set.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_AMPDU_KEYBORDER_SUPPORT: The card and driver is only
 *	aggregating MPDUs with the same keyid, allowing mac80211 to keep Tx
 *	A-MPDU sessions active while rekeying with Extended Key ID.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_ENCAP_OFFLOAD: Hardware supports tx encapsulation
 *	offload
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_RX_DECAP_OFFLOAD: Hardware supports rx decapsulation
 *	offload
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CONC_MON_RX_DECAP: Hardware supports concurrent rx
 *	decapsulation offload and passing raw 802.11 frames for monitor iface.
 *	If this is supported, the driver must pass both 802.3 frames for real
 *	usage and 802.11 frames with %RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR set for monitor to
 *	the stack.
 *
 * @NUM_IEEE80211_HW_FLAGS: number of hardware flags, used for sizing arrays

 *	bands (with channels, bitrates) are registered here.
 *
 * @conf: &struct ieee80211_conf, device configuration, don't use.
 *
 * @priv: pointer to private area that was allocated for driver use

 *	it shouldn't be set.
 *
 * @max_tx_aggregation_subframes: maximum number of subframes in an
 *	aggregate an HT/HE device will transmit. In HT AddBA we'll
 *	advertise a constant value of 64 as some older APs crash if
 *	the window size is smaller (an example is LinkSys WRT120N
 *	with FW v1.0.07 build 002 Jun 18 2012).
 *	For AddBA to HE capable peers this value will be used.

 *	field will be added and populated from the &struct ieee80211_rx_status
 *	device_timestamp.
 * @radiotap_timestamp.units_pos: Must be set to a combination of a
 *	IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_TIMESTAMP_UNIT_* and a
 *	IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_TIMESTAMP_SPOS_* value.

 *	radiotap field and the accuracy known flag will be set.
 *
 * @netdev_features: netdev features to be set in each netdev created

 *	other features will be rejected during HW registration.
 *
 * @uapsd_queues: This bitmap is included in (re)association frame to indicate
 *	for each access category if it is uAPSD trigger-enabled and delivery-
 *	enabled. Use IEEE80211_WMM_IE_STA_QOSINFO_AC_* to set this bitmap.

 *	that corresponding AC is both trigger- and delivery-enabled. '0' means
 *	neither enabled.
 *
 * @uapsd_max_sp_len: maximum number of total buffered frames the WMM AP may
 *	deliver to a WMM STA during any Service Period triggered by the WMM STA.
 *	Use IEEE80211_WMM_IE_STA_QOSINFO_SP_* for correct values.

 *	device.
 *
 * @tx_sk_pacing_shift: Pacing shift to set on TCP sockets when frames from
 *	them are encountered. The default should typically not be changed,
 *	unless the driver has good reasons for needing more buffers.
 *
 * @weight_multiplier: Driver specific airtime weight multiplier used while

 * device is called to enable hardware acceleration of encryption and
 * decryption. The callback takes a @sta parameter that will be NULL
 * for default keys or keys used for transmission only, or point to
 * the station information for the peer for individual keys.
 * Multiple transmission keys with the same key index may be used when
 * VLANs are configured for an access point.
 *
 * When transmitting, the TX control data will use the @hw_key_idx
 * selected by the driver by modifying the &struct ieee80211_key_conf
 * pointed to by the @key parameter to the set_key() function.
 *
 * The set_key() call for the %SET_KEY command should return 0 if
 * the key is now in use, -%EOPNOTSUPP or -%ENOSPC if it couldn't be
 * added; if you return 0 then hw_key_idx must be assigned to the
 * hardware key index, you are free to use the full u8 range.
 *
 * Note that in the case that the @IEEE80211_HW_SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL flag is
 * set, mac80211 will not automatically fall back to software crypto if
 * enabling hardware crypto failed. The set_key() call may also return the
 * value 1 to permit this specific key/algorithm to be done in software.
 *
 * When the cmd is %DISABLE_KEY then it must succeed.
 *
 * Note that it is permissible to not decrypt a frame even if a key
 * for it has been uploaded to hardware, the stack will not make any
 * decision based on whether a key has been uploaded or not but rather
 * based on the receive flags.
 *
 * The &struct ieee80211_key_conf structure pointed to by the @key
 * parameter is guaranteed to be valid until another call to set_key()
 * removes it, but it can only be used as a cookie to differentiate
 * keys.
 *
 * In TKIP some HW need to be provided a phase 1 key, for RX decryption
 * acceleration (i.e. iwlwifi). Those drivers should provide update_tkip_key
 * handler.
 * The update_tkip_key() call updates the driver with the new phase 1 key.
 * This happens every time the iv16 wraps around (every 65536 packets). The
 * set_key() call will happen only once for each key (unless the AP did
 * rekeying), it will not include a valid phase 1 key. The valid phase 1 key is
 * provided by update_tkip_key only. The trigger that makes mac80211 call this
 * handler is software decryption with wrap around of iv16.
 *
 * The set_default_unicast_key() call updates the default WEP key index
 * configured to the hardware for WEP encryption type. This is required
 * for devices that support offload of data packets (e.g. ARP responses).
 *
 * Mac80211 drivers should set the @NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CAN_REPLACE_PTK0 flag
 * when they are able to replace in-use PTK keys according to the following
 * requirements:
 * 1) They do not hand over frames decrypted with the old key to
      mac80211 once the call to set_key() with command %DISABLE_KEY has been
      completed when also setting @IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_GENERATE_IV for any key,
   2) either drop or continue to use the old key for any outgoing frames queued
      at the time of the key deletion (including re-transmits),
   3) never send out a frame queued prior to the set_key() %SET_KEY command
      encrypted with the new key and
   4) never send out a frame unencrypted when it should be encrypted.
   Mac80211 will not queue any new frames for a deleted key to the driver.

/**
 * DOC: Powersave support
 *
 * mac80211 has support for various powersave implementations.
 *
 * First, it can support hardware that handles all powersaving by itself,
 * such hardware should simply set the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS hardware
 * flag. In that case, it will be told about the desired powersave mode
 * with the %IEEE80211_CONF_PS flag depending on the association status.
 * The hardware must take care of sending nullfunc frames when necessary,
 * i.e. when entering and leaving powersave mode. The hardware is required
 * to look at the AID in beacons and signal to the AP that it woke up when
 * it finds traffic directed to it.
 *
 * %IEEE80211_CONF_PS flag enabled means that the powersave mode defined in
 * IEEE 802.11-2007 section 11.2 is enabled. This is not to be confused
 * with hardware wakeup and sleep states. Driver is responsible for waking
 * up the hardware before issuing commands to the hardware and putting it
 * back to sleep at appropriate times.
 *
 * When PS is enabled, hardware needs to wakeup for beacons and receive the
 * buffered multicast/broadcast frames after the beacon. Also it must be
 * possible to send frames and receive the acknowledment frame.
 *
 * Other hardware designs cannot send nullfunc frames by themselves and also
 * need software support for parsing the TIM bitmap. This is also supported
 * by mac80211 by combining the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS and
 * %IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK flags. The hardware is of course still
 * required to pass up beacons. The hardware is still required to handle
 * waking up for multicast traffic; if it cannot the driver must handle that
 * as best as it can, mac80211 is too slow to do that.
 *
 * Dynamic powersave is an extension to normal powersave in which the
 * hardware stays awake for a user-specified period of time after sending a
 * frame so that reply frames need not be buffered and therefore delayed to
 * the next wakeup. It's compromise of getting good enough latency when
 * there's data traffic and still saving significantly power in idle
 * periods.
 *
 * Dynamic powersave is simply supported by mac80211 enabling and disabling
 * PS based on traffic. Driver needs to only set %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS
 * flag and mac80211 will handle everything automatically. Additionally,
 * hardware having support for the dynamic PS feature may set the
 * %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS flag to indicate that it can support
 * dynamic PS mode itself. The driver needs to look at the
 * @dynamic_ps_timeout hardware configuration value and use it that value
 * whenever %IEEE80211_CONF_PS is set. In this case mac80211 will disable
 * dynamic PS feature in stack and will just keep %IEEE80211_CONF_PS
 * enabled whenever user has enabled powersave.
 *
 * Driver informs U-APSD client support by enabling
 * %IEEE80211_VIF_SUPPORTS_UAPSD flag. The mode is configured through the
 * uapsd parameter in conf_tx() operation. Hardware needs to send the QoS
 * Nullfunc frames and stay awake until the service period has ended. To
 * utilize U-APSD, dynamic powersave is disabled for voip AC and all frames
 * from that AC are transmitted with powersave enabled.
 *
 * Note: U-APSD client mode is not yet supported with
 * %IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK.

/**
 * DOC: Beacon filter support
 *
 * Some hardware have beacon filter support to reduce host cpu wakeups
 * which will reduce system power consumption. It usually works so that
 * the firmware creates a checksum of the beacon but omits all constantly
 * changing elements (TSF, TIM etc). Whenever the checksum changes the
 * beacon is forwarded to the host, otherwise it will be just dropped. That
 * way the host will only receive beacons where some relevant information
 * (for example ERP protection or WMM settings) have changed.
 *
 * Beacon filter support is advertised with the %IEEE80211_VIF_BEACON_FILTER
 * interface capability. The driver needs to enable beacon filter support
 * whenever power save is enabled, that is %IEEE80211_CONF_PS is set. When
 * power save is enabled, the stack will not check for beacon loss and the
 * driver needs to notify about loss of beacons with ieee80211_beacon_loss().
 *
 * The time (or number of beacons missed) until the firmware notifies the
 * driver of a beacon loss event (which in turn causes the driver to call
 * ieee80211_beacon_loss()) should be configurable and will be controlled
 * by mac80211 and the roaming algorithm in the future.
 *
 * Since there may be constantly changing information elements that nothing
 * in the software stack cares about, we will, in the future, have mac80211
 * tell the driver which information elements are interesting in the sense
 * that we want to see changes in them. This will include
 *
 *  - a list of information element IDs
 *  - a list of OUIs for the vendor information element
 *
 * Ideally, the hardware would filter out any beacons without changes in the
 * requested elements, but if it cannot support that it may, at the expense
 * of some efficiency, filter out only a subset. For example, if the device
 * doesn't support checking for OUIs it should pass up all changes in all
 * vendor information elements.
 *
 * Note that change, for the sake of simplification, also includes information
 * elements appearing or disappearing from the beacon.
 *
 * Some hardware supports an "ignore list" instead, just make sure nothing
 * that was requested is on the ignore list, and include commonly changing
 * information element IDs in the ignore list, for example 11 (BSS load) and
 * the various vendor-assigned IEs with unknown contents (128, 129, 133-136,
 * 149, 150, 155, 156, 173, 176, 178, 179, 219); for forward compatibility
 * it could also include some currently unused IDs.
 *
 *
 * In addition to these capabilities, hardware should support notifying the
 * host of changes in the beacon RSSI. This is relevant to implement roaming
 * when no traffic is flowing (when traffic is flowing we see the RSSI of
 * the received data packets). This can consist in notifying the host when
 * the RSSI changes significantly or when it drops below or rises above
 * configurable thresholds. In the future these thresholds will also be
 * configured by mac80211 (which gets them from userspace) to implement
 * them as the roaming algorithm requires.
 *
 * If the hardware cannot implement this, the driver should ask it to
 * periodically pass beacon frames to the host so that software can do the
 * signal strength threshold checking.

/**
 * DOC: Spatial multiplexing power save
 *
 * SMPS (Spatial multiplexing power save) is a mechanism to conserve
 * power in an 802.11n implementation. For details on the mechanism
 * and rationale, please refer to 802.11 (as amended by 802.11n-2009)
 * "11.2.3 SM power save".
 *
 * The mac80211 implementation is capable of sending action frames
 * to update the AP about the station's SMPS mode, and will instruct
 * the driver to enter the specific mode. It will also announce the
 * requested SMPS mode during the association handshake. Hardware
 * support for this feature is required, and can be indicated by
 * hardware flags.
 *
 * The default mode will be "automatic", which nl80211/cfg80211
 * defines to be dynamic SMPS in (regular) powersave, and SMPS
 * turned off otherwise.
 *
 * To support this feature, the driver must set the appropriate
 * hardware support flags, and handle the SMPS flag to the config()
 * operation. It will then with this mechanism be instructed to
 * enter the requested SMPS mode while associated to an HT AP.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame filtering
 *
 * mac80211 requires to see many management frames for proper
 * operation, and users may want to see many more frames when
 * in monitor mode. However, for best CPU usage and power consumption,
 * having as few frames as possible percolate through the stack is
 * desirable. Hence, the hardware should filter as much as possible.
 *
 * To achieve this, mac80211 uses filter flags (see below) to tell
 * the driver's configure_filter() function which frames should be
 * passed to mac80211 and which should be filtered out.
 *
 * Before configure_filter() is invoked, the prepare_multicast()
 * callback is invoked with the parameters @mc_count and @mc_list
 * for the combined multicast address list of all virtual interfaces.
 * It's use is optional, and it returns a u64 that is passed to
 * configure_filter(). Additionally, configure_filter() has the
 * arguments @changed_flags telling which flags were changed and
 * @total_flags with the new flag states.
 *
 * If your device has no multicast address filters your driver will
 * need to check both the %FIF_ALLMULTI flag and the @mc_count
 * parameter to see whether multicast frames should be accepted
 * or dropped.
 *
 * All unsupported flags in @total_flags must be cleared.
 * Hardware does not support a flag if it is incapable of _passing_
 * the frame to the stack. Otherwise the driver must ignore
 * the flag, but not clear it.
 * You must _only_ clear the flag (announce no support for the
 * flag to mac80211) if you are not able to pass the packet type
 * to the stack (so the hardware always filters it).
 * So for example, you should clear @FIF_CONTROL, if your hardware
 * always filters control frames. If your hardware always passes
 * control frames to the kernel and is incapable of filtering them,
 * you do _not_ clear the @FIF_CONTROL flag.
 * This rule applies to all other FIF flags as well.
 */

/**
 * DOC: AP support for powersaving clients
 *
 * In order to implement AP and P2P GO modes, mac80211 has support for
 * client powersaving, both "legacy" PS (PS-Poll/null data) and uAPSD.
 * There currently is no support for sAPSD.
 *
 * There is one assumption that mac80211 makes, namely that a client
 * will not poll with PS-Poll and trigger with uAPSD at the same time.
 * Both are supported, and both can be used by the same client, but
 * they can't be used concurrently by the same client. This simplifies
 * the driver code.
 *
 * The first thing to keep in mind is that there is a flag for complete
 * driver implementation: %IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS. If this flag is set,
 * mac80211 expects the driver to handle most of the state machine for
 * powersaving clients and will ignore the PM bit in incoming frames.
 * Drivers then use ieee80211_sta_ps_transition() to inform mac80211 of
 * stations' powersave transitions. In this mode, mac80211 also doesn't
 * handle PS-Poll/uAPSD.
 *
 * In the mode without %IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS, mac80211 will check the
 * PM bit in incoming frames for client powersave transitions. When a
 * station goes to sleep, we will stop transmitting to it. There is,
 * however, a race condition: a station might go to sleep while there is
 * data buffered on hardware queues. If the device has support for this
 * it will reject frames, and the driver should give the frames back to
 * mac80211 with the %IEEE80211_TX_STAT_TX_FILTERED flag set which will
 * cause mac80211 to retry the frame when the station wakes up. The
 * driver is also notified of powersave transitions by calling its
 * @sta_notify callback.
 *
 * When the station is asleep, it has three choices: it can wake up,
 * it can PS-Poll, or it can possibly start a uAPSD service period.
 * Waking up is implemented by simply transmitting all buffered (and
 * filtered) frames to the station. This is the easiest case. When
 * the station sends a PS-Poll or a uAPSD trigger frame, mac80211
 * will inform the driver of this with the @allow_buffered_frames
 * callback; this callback is optional. mac80211 will then transmit
 * the frames as usual and set the %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_PS_BUFFER
 * on each frame. The last frame in the service period (or the only
 * response to a PS-Poll) also has %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP set to
 * indicate that it ends the service period; as this frame must have
 * TX status report it also sets %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_REQ_TX_STATUS.
 * When TX status is reported for this frame, the service period is
 * marked has having ended and a new one can be started by the peer.
 *
 * Additionally, non-bufferable MMPDUs can also be transmitted by
 * mac80211 with the %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_PS_BUFFER set in them.
 *
 * Another race condition can happen on some devices like iwlwifi
 * when there are frames queued for the station and it wakes up
 * or polls; the frames that are already queued could end up being
 * transmitted first instead, causing reordering and/or wrong
 * processing of the EOSP. The cause is that allowing frames to be
 * transmitted to a certain station is out-of-band communication to
 * the device. To allow this problem to be solved, the driver can
 * call ieee80211_sta_block_awake() if frames are buffered when it
 * is notified that the station went to sleep. When all these frames
 * have been filtered (see above), it must call the function again
 * to indicate that the station is no longer blocked.
 *
 * If the driver buffers frames in the driver for aggregation in any
 * way, it must use the ieee80211_sta_set_buffered() call when it is
 * notified of the station going to sleep to inform mac80211 of any
 * TIDs that have frames buffered. Note that when a station wakes up
 * this information is reset (hence the requirement to call it when
 * informed of the station going to sleep). Then, when a service
 * period starts for any reason, @release_buffered_frames is called
 * with the number of frames to be released and which TIDs they are
 * to come from. In this case, the driver is responsible for setting
 * the EOSP (for uAPSD) and MORE_DATA bits in the released frames,
 * to help the @more_data parameter is passed to tell the driver if
 * there is more data on other TIDs -- the TIDs to release frames
 * from are ignored since mac80211 doesn't know how many frames the
 * buffers for those TIDs contain.
 *
 * If the driver also implement GO mode, where absence periods may
 * shorten service periods (or abort PS-Poll responses), it must
 * filter those response frames except in the case of frames that
 * are buffered in the driver -- those must remain buffered to avoid
 * reordering. Because it is possible that no frames are released
 * in this case, the driver must call ieee80211_sta_eosp()
 * to indicate to mac80211 that the service period ended anyway.
 *
 * Finally, if frames from multiple TIDs are released from mac80211
 * but the driver might reorder them, it must clear & set the flags
 * appropriately (only the last frame may have %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP)
 * and also take care of the EOSP and MORE_DATA bits in the frame.
 * The driver may also use ieee80211_sta_eosp() in this case.
 *
 * Note that if the driver ever buffers frames other than QoS-data
 * frames, it must take care to never send a non-QoS-data frame as
 * the last frame in a service period, adding a QoS-nulldata frame
 * after a non-QoS-data frame if needed.
 */

/**
 * DOC: HW queue control
 *
 * Before HW queue control was introduced, mac80211 only had a single static
 * assignment of per-interface AC software queues to hardware queues. This
 * was problematic for a few reasons:
 * 1) off-channel transmissions might get stuck behind other frames
 * 2) multiple virtual interfaces couldn't be handled correctly
 * 3) after-DTIM frames could get stuck behind other frames
 *
 * To solve this, hardware typically uses multiple different queues for all
 * the different usages, and this needs to be propagated into mac80211 so it
 * won't have the same problem with the software queues.
 *
 * Therefore, mac80211 now offers the %IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL capability
 * flag that tells it that the driver implements its own queue control. To do
 * so, the driver will set up the various queues in each &struct ieee80211_vif
 * and the offchannel queue in &struct ieee80211_hw. In response, mac80211 will
 * use those queue IDs in the hw_queue field of &struct ieee80211_tx_info and
 * if necessary will queue the frame on the right software queue that mirrors
 * the hardware queue.
 * Additionally, the driver has to then use these HW queue IDs for the queue
 * management functions (ieee80211_stop_queue() et al.)
 *
 * The driver is free to set up the queue mappings as needed, multiple virtual
 * interfaces may map to the same hardware queues if needed. The setup has to
 * happen during add_interface or change_interface callbacks. For example, a
 * driver supporting station+station and station+AP modes might decide to have
 * 10 hardware queues to handle different scenarios:
 *
 * 4 AC HW queues for 1st vif: 0, 1, 2, 3
 * 4 AC HW queues for 2nd vif: 4, 5, 6, 7
 * after-DTIM queue for AP:   8
 * off-channel queue:         9
 *
 * It would then set up the hardware like this:
 *   hw.offchannel_tx_hw_queue = 9
 *
 * and the first virtual interface that is added as follows:
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_VO] = 0
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_VI] = 1
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_BE] = 2
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_BK] = 3
 *   vif.cab_queue = 8 // if AP mode, otherwise %IEEE80211_INVAL_HW_QUEUE
 * and the second virtual interface with 4-7.
 *
 * If queue 6 gets full, for example, mac80211 would only stop the second
 * virtual interface's BE queue since virtual interface queues are per AC.
 *
 * Note that the vif.cab_queue value should be set to %IEEE80211_INVAL_HW_QUEUE
 * whenever the queue is not used (i.e. the interface is not in AP mode) if the
 * queue could potentially be shared since mac80211 will look at cab_queue when
 * a queue is stopped/woken even if the interface is not in AP mode.

/**
 * struct ieee80211_ops - callbacks from mac80211 to the driver
 *
 * This structure contains various callbacks that the driver may
 * handle or, in some cases, must handle, for example to configure
 * the hardware to a new channel or to transmit a frame.
 *
 * @tx: Handler that 802.11 module calls for each transmitted frame.
 *	skb contains the buffer starting from the IEEE 802.11 header.
 *	The low-level driver should send the frame out based on
 *	configuration in the TX control data. This handler should,
 *	preferably, never fail and stop queues appropriately.
 *	Must be atomic.
 *
 * @start: Called before the first netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is enabled. This should turn on the hardware and must turn on
 *	frame reception (for possibly enabled monitor interfaces.)
 *	Returns negative error codes, these may be seen in userspace,
 *	or zero.
 *	When the device is started it should not have a MAC address
 *	to avoid acknowledging frames before a non-monitor device
 *	is added.
 *	Must be implemented and can sleep.
 *
 * @stop: Called after last netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is disabled. This should turn off the hardware (at least
 *	it must turn off frame reception.)
 *	May be called right after add_interface if that rejects
 *	an interface. If you added any work onto the mac80211 workqueue
 *	you should ensure to cancel it on this callback.
 *	Must be implemented and can sleep.
 *
 * @suspend: Suspend the device; mac80211 itself will quiesce before and
 *	stop transmitting and doing any other configuration, and then
 *	ask the device to suspend. This is only invoked when WoWLAN is
 *	configured, otherwise the device is deconfigured completely and
 *	reconfigured at resume time.
 *	The driver may also impose special conditions under which it
 *	wants to use the "normal" suspend (deconfigure), say if it only
 *	supports WoWLAN when the device is associated. In this case, it
 *	must return 1 from this function.
 *
 * @resume: If WoWLAN was configured, this indicates that mac80211 is
 *	now resuming its operation, after this the device must be fully
 *	functional again. If this returns an error, the only way out is
 *	to also unregister the device. If it returns 1, then mac80211
 *	will also go through the regular complete restart on resume.
 *
 * @set_wakeup: Enable or disable wakeup when WoWLAN configuration is
 *	modified. The reason is that device_set_wakeup_enable() is
 *	supposed to be called when the configuration changes, not only
 *	in suspend().
 *
 * @add_interface: Called when a netdevice attached to the hardware is
 *	enabled. Because it is not called for monitor mode devices, @start
 *	and @stop must be implemented.
 *	The driver should perform any initialization it needs before
 *	the device can be enabled. The initial configuration for the
 *	interface is given in the conf parameter.
 *	The callback may refuse to add an interface by returning a
 *	negative error code (which will be seen in userspace.)
 *	Must be implemented and can sleep.
 *
 * @change_interface: Called when a netdevice changes type. This callback
 *	is optional, but only if it is supported can interface types be
 *	switched while the interface is UP. The callback may sleep.
 *	Note that while an interface is being switched, it will not be
 *	found by the interface iteration callbacks.
 *
 * @remove_interface: Notifies a driver that an interface is going down.
 *	The @stop callback is called after this if it is the last interface
 *	and no monitor interfaces are present.
 *	When all interfaces are removed, the MAC address in the hardware
 *	must be cleared so the device no longer acknowledges packets,
 *	the mac_addr member of the conf structure is, however, set to the
 *	MAC address of the device going away.
 *	Hence, this callback must be implemented. It can sleep.
 *
 * @config: Handler for configuration requests. IEEE 802.11 code calls this
 *	function to change hardware configuration, e.g., channel.
 *	This function should never fail but returns a negative error code
 *	if it does. The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @bss_info_changed: Handler for configuration requests related to BSS
 *	parameters that may vary during BSS's lifespan, and may affect low
 *	level driver (e.g. assoc/disassoc status, erp parameters).
 *	This function should not be used if no BSS has been set, unless
 *	for association indication. The @changed parameter indicates which
 *	of the bss parameters has changed when a call is made. The callback
 *	can sleep.
 *
 * @prepare_multicast: Prepare for multicast filter configuration.
 *	This callback is optional, and its return value is passed
 *	to configure_filter(). This callback must be atomic.
 *
 * @configure_filter: Configure the device's RX filter.
 *	See the section "Frame filtering" for more information.
 *	This callback must be implemented and can sleep.
 *
 * @config_iface_filter: Configure the interface's RX filter.
 *	This callback is optional and is used to configure which frames
 *	should be passed to mac80211. The filter_flags is the combination
 *	of FIF_* flags. The changed_flags is a bit mask that indicates
 *	which flags are changed.
 *	This callback can sleep.
 *
 * @set_tim: Set TIM bit. mac80211 calls this function when a TIM bit
 * 	must be set or cleared for a given STA. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @set_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 *	This callback is only called between add_interface and
 *	remove_interface calls, i.e. while the given virtual interface
 *	is enabled.
 *	Returns a negative error code if the key can't be added.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @update_tkip_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 * 	This callback will be called in the context of Rx. Called for drivers
 * 	which set IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_TKIP_REQ_RX_P1_KEY.
 *	The callback must be atomic.
 *
 * @set_rekey_data: If the device supports GTK rekeying, for example while the
 *	host is suspended, it can assign this callback to retrieve the data
 *	necessary to do GTK rekeying, this is the KEK, KCK and replay counter.
 *	After rekeying was done it should (for example during resume) notify
 *	userspace of the new replay counter using ieee80211_gtk_rekey_notify().
 *
 * @set_default_unicast_key: Set the default (unicast) key index, useful for
 *	WEP when the device sends data packets autonomously, e.g. for ARP
 *	offloading. The index can be 0-3, or -1 for unsetting it.
 *
 * @hw_scan: Ask the hardware to service the scan request, no need to start
 *	the scan state machine in stack. The scan must honour the channel
 *	configuration done by the regulatory agent in the wiphy's
 *	registered bands. The hardware (or the driver) needs to make sure
 *	that power save is disabled.
 *	The @req ie/ie_len members are rewritten by mac80211 to contain the
 *	entire IEs after the SSID, so that drivers need not look at these
 *	at all but just send them after the SSID -- mac80211 includes the
 *	(extended) supported rates and HT information (where applicable).
 *	When the scan finishes, ieee80211_scan_completed() must be called;
 *	note that it also must be called when the scan cannot finish due to
 *	any error unless this callback returned a negative error code.
 *	This callback is also allowed to return the special return value 1,
 *	this indicates that hardware scan isn't desirable right now and a
 *	software scan should be done instead. A driver wishing to use this
 *	capability must ensure its (hardware) scan capabilities aren't
 *	advertised as more capable than mac80211's software scan is.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @cancel_hw_scan: Ask the low-level tp cancel the active hw scan.
 *	The driver should ask the hardware to cancel the scan (if possible),
 *	but the scan will be completed only after the driver will call
 *	ieee80211_scan_completed().
 *	This callback is needed for wowlan, to prevent enqueueing a new
 *	scan_work after the low-level driver was already suspended.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sched_scan_start: Ask the hardware to start scanning repeatedly at
 *	specific intervals.  The driver must call the
 *	ieee80211_sched_scan_results() function whenever it finds results.
 *	This process will continue until sched_scan_stop is called.
 *
 * @sched_scan_stop: Tell the hardware to stop an ongoing scheduled scan.
 *	In this case, ieee80211_sched_scan_stopped() must not be called.
 *
 * @sw_scan_start: Notifier function that is called just before a software scan
 *	is started. Can be NULL, if the driver doesn't need this notification.
 *	The mac_addr parameter allows supporting NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_RANDOM_ADDR,
 *	the driver may set the NL80211_FEATURE_SCAN_RANDOM_MAC_ADDR flag if it
 *	can use this parameter. The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sw_scan_complete: Notifier function that is called just after a
 *	software scan finished. Can be NULL, if the driver doesn't need
 *	this notification.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @get_stats: Return low-level statistics.
 * 	Returns zero if statistics are available.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @get_key_seq: If your device implements encryption in hardware and does
 *	IV/PN assignment then this callback should be provided to read the
 *	IV/PN for the given key from hardware.
 *	The callback must be atomic.
 *
 * @set_frag_threshold: Configuration of fragmentation threshold. Assign this
 *	if the device does fragmentation by itself. Note that to prevent the
 *	stack from doing fragmentation IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_FRAG
 *	should be set as well.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @set_rts_threshold: Configuration of RTS threshold (if device needs it)
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_add: Notifies low level driver about addition of an associated station,
 *	AP, IBSS/WDS/mesh peer etc. This callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_remove: Notifies low level driver about removal of an associated
 *	station, AP, IBSS/WDS/mesh peer etc. Note that after the callback
 *	returns it isn't safe to use the pointer, not even RCU protected;
 *	no RCU grace period is guaranteed between returning here and freeing
 *	the station. See @sta_pre_rcu_remove if needed.
 *	This callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_add_debugfs: Drivers can use this callback to add debugfs files
 *	when a station is added to mac80211's station list. This callback
 *	should be within a CONFIG_MAC80211_DEBUGFS conditional. This
 *	callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_notify: Notifies low level driver about power state transition of an
 *	associated station, AP,  IBSS/WDS/mesh peer etc. For a VIF operating
 *	in AP mode, this callback will not be called when the flag
 *	%IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS is set. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @sta_set_txpwr: Configure the station tx power. This callback set the tx
 *	power for the station.
 *	This callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_state: Notifies low level driver about state transition of a
 *	station (which can be the AP, a client, IBSS/WDS/mesh peer etc.)
 *	This callback is mutually exclusive with @sta_add/@sta_remove.
 *	It must not fail for down transitions but may fail for transitions
 *	up the list of states. Also note that after the callback returns it
 *	isn't safe to use the pointer, not even RCU protected - no RCU grace
 *	period is guaranteed between returning here and freeing the station.
 *	See @sta_pre_rcu_remove if needed.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_pre_rcu_remove: Notify driver about station removal before RCU
 *	synchronisation. This is useful if a driver needs to have station
 *	pointers protected using RCU, it can then use this call to clear
 *	the pointers instead of waiting for an RCU grace period to elapse
 *	in @sta_state.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @sta_rc_update: Notifies the driver of changes to the bitrates that can be
 *	used to transmit to the station. The changes are advertised with bits
 *	from &enum ieee80211_rate_control_changed and the values are reflected
 *	in the station data. This callback should only be used when the driver
 *	uses hardware rate control (%IEEE80211_HW_HAS_RATE_CONTROL) since
 *	otherwise the rate control algorithm is notified directly.
 *	Must be atomic.
 * @sta_rate_tbl_update: Notifies the driver that the rate table changed. This
 *	is only used if the configured rate control algorithm actually uses
 *	the new rate table API, and is therefore optional. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @sta_statistics: Get statistics for this station. For example with beacon
 *	filtering, the statistics kept by mac80211 might not be accurate, so
 *	let the driver pre-fill the statistics. The driver can fill most of
 *	the values (indicating which by setting the filled bitmap), but not
 *	all of them make sense - see the source for which ones are possible.
 *	Statistics that the driver doesn't fill will be filled by mac80211.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @conf_tx: Configure TX queue parameters (EDCF (aifs, cw_min, cw_max),
 *	bursting) for a hardware TX queue.
 *	Returns a negative error code on failure.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @get_tsf: Get the current TSF timer value from firmware/hardware. Currently,
 *	this is only used for IBSS mode BSSID merging and debugging. Is not a
 *	required function.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @set_tsf: Set the TSF timer to the specified value in the firmware/hardware.
 *	Currently, this is only used for IBSS mode debugging. Is not a
 *	required function.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @offset_tsf: Offset the TSF timer by the specified value in the
 *	firmware/hardware.  Preferred to set_tsf as it avoids delay between
 *	calling set_tsf() and hardware getting programmed, which will show up
 *	as TSF delay. Is not a required function.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @reset_tsf: Reset the TSF timer and allow firmware/hardware to synchronize
 *	with other STAs in the IBSS. This is only used in IBSS mode. This
 *	function is optional if the firmware/hardware takes full care of
 *	TSF synchronization.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @tx_last_beacon: Determine whether the last IBSS beacon was sent by us.
 *	This is needed only for IBSS mode and the result of this function is
 *	used to determine whether to reply to Probe Requests.
 *	Returns non-zero if this device sent the last beacon.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @get_survey: Return per-channel survey information
 *
 * @rfkill_poll: Poll rfkill hardware state. If you need this, you also
 *	need to set wiphy->rfkill_poll to %true before registration,
 *	and need to call wiphy_rfkill_set_hw_state() in the callback.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @set_coverage_class: Set slot time for given coverage class as specified
 *	in IEEE 802.11-2007 section 17.3.8.6 and modify ACK timeout
 *	accordingly; coverage class equals to -1 to enable ACK timeout
 *	estimation algorithm (dynack). To disable dynack set valid value for
 *	coverage class. This callback is not required and may sleep.
 *
 * @testmode_cmd: Implement a cfg80211 test mode command. The passed @vif may
 *	be %NULL. The callback can sleep.
 * @testmode_dump: Implement a cfg80211 test mode dump. The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @flush: Flush all pending frames from the hardware queue, making sure
 *	that the hardware queues are empty. The @queues parameter is a bitmap
 *	of queues to flush, which is useful if different virtual interfaces
 *	use different hardware queues; it may also indicate all queues.
 *	If the parameter @drop is set to %true, pending frames may be dropped.
 *	Note that vif can be NULL.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 *
 * @channel_switch: Drivers that need (or want) to offload the channel
 *	switch operation for CSAs received from the AP may implement this
 *	callback. They must then call ieee80211_chswitch_done() to indicate
 *	completion of the channel switch.
 *
 * @set_antenna: Set antenna configuration (tx_ant, rx_ant) on the device.
 *	Parameters are bitmaps of allowed antennas to use for TX/RX. Drivers may
 *	reject TX/RX mask combinations they cannot support by returning -EINVAL
 *	(also see nl80211.h @NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_ANTENNA_TX).
 *
 * @get_antenna: Get current antenna configuration from device (tx_ant, rx_ant).
 *
 * @remain_on_channel: Starts an off-channel period on the given channel, must
 *	call back to ieee80211_ready_on_channel() when on that channel. Note
 *	that normal channel traffic is not stopped as this is intended for hw
 *	offload. Frames to transmit on the off-channel channel are transmitted
 *	normally except for the %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_TX_OFFCHAN flag. When the
 *	duration (which will always be non-zero) expires, the driver must call
 *	ieee80211_remain_on_channel_expired().
 *	Note that this callback may be called while the device is in IDLE and
 *	must be accepted in this case.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @cancel_remain_on_channel: Requests that an ongoing off-channel period is
 *	aborted before it expires. This callback may sleep.
 *
 * @set_ringparam: Set tx and rx ring sizes.
 *
 * @get_ringparam: Get tx and rx ring current and maximum sizes.
 *
 * @tx_frames_pending: Check if there is any pending frame in the hardware
 *	queues before entering power save.
 *
 * @set_bitrate_mask: Set a mask of rates to be used for rate control selection
 *	when transmitting a frame. Currently only legacy rates are handled.
 *	The callback can sleep.
 * @event_callback: Notify driver about any event in mac80211. See
 *	&enum ieee80211_event_type for the different types.
 *	The callback must be atomic.
 *
 * @release_buffered_frames: Release buffered frames according to the given
 *	parameters. In the case where the driver buffers some frames for
 *	sleeping stations mac80211 will use this callback to tell the driver
 *	to release some frames, either for PS-poll or uAPSD.
 *	Note that if the @more_data parameter is %false the driver must check
 *	if there are more frames on the given TIDs, and if there are more than
 *	the frames being released then it must still set the more-data bit in
 *	the frame. If the @more_data parameter is %true, then of course the
 *	more-data bit must always be set.
 *	The @tids parameter tells the driver which TIDs to release frames
 *	from, for PS-poll it will always have only a single bit set.
 *	In the case this is used for a PS-poll initiated release, the
 *	@num_frames parameter will always be 1 so code can be shared. In
 *	this case the driver must also set %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP flag
 *	on the TX status (and must report TX status) so that the PS-poll
 *	period is properly ended. This is used to avoid sending multiple
 *	responses for a retried PS-poll frame.
 *	In the case this is used for uAPSD, the @num_frames parameter may be
 *	bigger than one, but the driver may send fewer frames (it must send
 *	at least one, however). In this case it is also responsible for
 *	setting the EOSP flag in the QoS header of the frames. Also, when the
 *	service period ends, the driver must set %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP
 *	on the last frame in the SP. Alternatively, it may call the function
 *	ieee80211_sta_eosp() to inform mac80211 of the end of the SP.
 *	This callback must be atomic.
 * @allow_buffered_frames: Prepare device to allow the given number of frames
 *	to go out to the given station. The frames will be sent by mac80211
 *	via the usual TX path after this call. The TX information for frames
 *	released will also have the %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_PS_BUFFER flag set
 *	and the last one will also have %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP set. In case
 *	frames from multiple TIDs are released and the driver might reorder
 *	them between the TIDs, it must set the %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP flag
 *	on the last frame and clear it on all others and also handle the EOSP
 *	bit in the QoS header correctly. Alternatively, it can also call the
 *	ieee80211_sta_eosp() function.
 *	The @tids parameter is a bitmap and tells the driver which TIDs the
 *	frames will be on; it will at most have two bits set.
 *	This callback must be atomic.
 *
 * @get_et_sset_count:  Ethtool API to get string-set count.
 *
 * @get_et_stats:  Ethtool API to get a set of u64 stats.
 *
 * @get_et_strings:  Ethtool API to get a set of strings to describe stats
 *	and perhaps other supported types of ethtool data-sets.
 *
 * @mgd_prepare_tx: Prepare for transmitting a management frame for association
 *	before associated. In multi-channel scenarios, a virtual interface is
 *	bound to a channel before it is associated, but as it isn't associated
 *	yet it need not necessarily be given airtime, in particular since any
 *	transmission to a P2P GO needs to be synchronized against the GO's
 *	powersave state. mac80211 will call this function before transmitting a
 *	management frame prior to having successfully associated to allow the
 *	driver to give it channel time for the transmission, to get a response
 *	and to be able to synchronize with the GO.
 *	For drivers that set %IEEE80211_HW_DEAUTH_NEED_MGD_TX_PREP, mac80211
 *	would also call this function before transmitting a deauthentication
 *	frame in case that no beacon was heard from the AP/P2P GO.
 *	The callback will be called before each transmission and upon return
 *	mac80211 will transmit the frame right away.
 *      If duration is greater than zero, mac80211 hints to the driver the
 *      duration for which the operation is requested.
 *	The callback is optional and can (should!) sleep.
 *
 * @mgd_protect_tdls_discover: Protect a TDLS discovery session. After sending
 *	a TDLS discovery-request, we expect a reply to arrive on the AP's
 *	channel. We must stay on the channel (no PSM, scan, etc.), since a TDLS
 *	setup-response is a direct packet not buffered by the AP.
 *	mac80211 will call this function just before the transmission of a TDLS
 *	discovery-request. The recommended period of protection is at least
 *	2 * (DTIM period).
 *	The callback is optional and can sleep.
 *
 * @add_chanctx: Notifies device driver about new channel context creation.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @remove_chanctx: Notifies device driver about channel context destruction.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @change_chanctx: Notifies device driver about channel context changes that
 *	may happen when combining different virtual interfaces on the same
 *	channel context with different settings
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @assign_vif_chanctx: Notifies device driver about channel context being bound
 *	to vif. Possible use is for hw queue remapping.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @unassign_vif_chanctx: Notifies device driver about channel context being
 *	unbound from vif.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @switch_vif_chanctx: switch a number of vifs from one chanctx to
 *	another, as specified in the list of
 *	@ieee80211_vif_chanctx_switch passed to the driver, according
 *	to the mode defined in &ieee80211_chanctx_switch_mode.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 *
 * @start_ap: Start operation on the AP interface, this is called after all the
 *	information in bss_conf is set and beacon can be retrieved. A channel
 *	context is bound before this is called. Note that if the driver uses
 *	software scan or ROC, this (and @stop_ap) isn't called when the AP is
 *	just "paused" for scanning/ROC, which is indicated by the beacon being
 *	disabled/enabled via @bss_info_changed.
 * @stop_ap: Stop operation on the AP interface.
 *
 * @reconfig_complete: Called after a call to ieee80211_restart_hw() and
 *	during resume, when the reconfiguration has completed.
 *	This can help the driver implement the reconfiguration step (and
 *	indicate mac80211 is ready to receive frames).
 *	This callback may sleep.
 *
 * @ipv6_addr_change: IPv6 address assignment on the given interface changed.
 *	Currently, this is only called for managed or P2P client interfaces.
 *	This callback is optional; it must not sleep.
 *
 * @channel_switch_beacon: Starts a channel switch to a new channel.
 *	Beacons are modified to include CSA or ECSA IEs before calling this
 *	function. The corresponding count fields in these IEs must be
 *	decremented, and when they reach 1 the driver must call
 *	ieee80211_csa_finish(). Drivers which use ieee80211_beacon_get()
 *	get the csa counter decremented by mac80211, but must check if it is
 *	1 using ieee80211_beacon_counter_is_complete() after the beacon has been
 *	transmitted and then call ieee80211_csa_finish().
 *	If the CSA count starts as zero or 1, this function will not be called,
 *	since there won't be any time to beacon before the switch anyway.
 * @pre_channel_switch: This is an optional callback that is called
 *	before a channel switch procedure is started (ie. when a STA
 *	gets a CSA or a userspace initiated channel-switch), allowing
 *	the driver to prepare for the channel switch.
 * @post_channel_switch: This is an optional callback that is called
 *	after a channel switch procedure is completed, allowing the
 *	driver to go back to a normal configuration.
 * @abort_channel_switch: This is an optional callback that is called
 *	when channel switch procedure was completed, allowing the
 *	driver to go back to a normal configuration.
 * @channel_switch_rx_beacon: This is an optional callback that is called
 *	when channel switch procedure is in progress and additional beacon with
 *	CSA IE was received, allowing driver to track changes in count.
 * @join_ibss: Join an IBSS (on an IBSS interface); this is called after all
 *	information in bss_conf is set up and the beacon can be retrieved. A
 *	channel context is bound before this is called.
 * @leave_ibss: Leave the IBSS again.
 *
 * @get_expected_throughput: extract the expected throughput towards the
 *	specified station. The returned value is expressed in Kbps. It returns 0
 *	if the RC algorithm does not have proper data to provide.
 *
 * @get_txpower: get current maximum tx power (in dBm) based on configuration
 *	and hardware limits.
 *
 * @tdls_channel_switch: Start channel-switching with a TDLS peer. The driver
 *	is responsible for continually initiating channel-switching operations
 *	and returning to the base channel for communication with the AP. The
 *	driver receives a channel-switch request template and the location of
 *	the switch-timing IE within the template as part of the invocation.
 *	The template is valid only within the call, and the driver can
 *	optionally copy the skb for further re-use.
 * @tdls_cancel_channel_switch: Stop channel-switching with a TDLS peer. Both
 *	peers must be on the base channel when the call completes.
 * @tdls_recv_channel_switch: a TDLS channel-switch related frame (request or
 *	response) has been received from a remote peer. The driver gets
 *	parameters parsed from the incoming frame and may use them to continue
 *	an ongoing channel-switch operation. In addition, a channel-switch
 *	response template is provided, together with the location of the
 *	switch-timing IE within the template. The skb can only be used within
 *	the function call.
 *
 * @wake_tx_queue: Called when new packets have been added to the queue.
 * @sync_rx_queues: Process all pending frames in RSS queues. This is a
 *	synchronization which is needed in case driver has in its RSS queues
 *	pending frames that were received prior to the control path action
 *	currently taken (e.g. disassociation) but are not processed yet.
 *
 * @start_nan: join an existing NAN cluster, or create a new one.
 * @stop_nan: leave the NAN cluster.
 * @nan_change_conf: change NAN configuration. The data in cfg80211_nan_conf
 *	contains full new configuration and changes specify which parameters
 *	are changed with respect to the last NAN config.
 *	The driver gets both full configuration and the changed parameters since
 *	some devices may need the full configuration while others need only the
 *	changed parameters.
 * @add_nan_func: Add a NAN function. Returns 0 on success. The data in
 *	cfg80211_nan_func must not be referenced outside the scope of
 *	this call.
 * @del_nan_func: Remove a NAN function. The driver must call
 *	ieee80211_nan_func_terminated() with
 *	NL80211_NAN_FUNC_TERM_REASON_USER_REQUEST reason code upon removal.
 * @can_aggregate_in_amsdu: Called in order to determine if HW supports
 *	aggregating two specific frames in the same A-MSDU. The relation
 *	between the skbs should be symmetric and transitive. Note that while
 *	skb is always a real frame, head may or may not be an A-MSDU.
 * @get_ftm_responder_stats: Retrieve FTM responder statistics, if available.
 *	Statistics should be cumulative, currently no way to reset is provided.
 *
 * @start_pmsr: start peer measurement (e.g. FTM) (this call can sleep)
 * @abort_pmsr: abort peer measurement (this call can sleep)
 * @set_tid_config: Apply TID specific configurations. This callback may sleep.
 * @reset_tid_config: Reset TID specific configuration for the peer.
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @update_vif_offload: Update virtual interface offload flags
 *	This callback may sleep.
 * @sta_set_4addr: Called to notify the driver when a station starts/stops using
 *	4-address mode
 * @set_sar_specs: Update the SAR (TX power) settings.
 * @sta_set_decap_offload: Called to notify the driver when a station is allowed
 *	to use rx decapsulation offload

	 * - ``TX:        8..1...``
	 *
	 * which is invalid since #1 was now re-transmitted well past the
