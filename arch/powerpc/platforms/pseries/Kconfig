	  Enabling this option will make the kernel run more efficiently

	  Say Y if you are unsure.

config DTL
	bool "Dispatch Trace Log"
	depends on PPC_SPLPAR && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  SPLPAR machines can log hypervisor preempt & dispatch events to a
	  kernel buffer. Saying Y here will enable logging these events,
	  which are accessible through a debugfs file.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config IO_EVENT_IRQ
	bool "IO Event Interrupt support"
	depends on PPC_PSERIES
	default y
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to enable support for IO Event
	  interrupts. IO event interrupt is a mechanism provided by RTAS
	  to return information about hardware error and non-error events
	  which may need OS attention. RTAS returns events for multiple
	  event types and scopes. Device drivers can register their handlers
	  to receive events.

	  This option will only enable the IO event platform code. You
	  will still need to enable or compile the actual drivers
	  that use this infrastructure to handle IO event interrupts.

	  Say Y if you are unsure.

	  Say Y here if you want the pseries core to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with the pseries core and want to see more of what is
	  going on. This does not enable debugging in lpar.c, which must
	  be manually done due to its verbosity.

config PPC_SMLPAR
	bool "Support for shared-memory logical partitions"
	depends on PPC_PSERIES
	select LPARCFG
	help
	  Select this option to enable shared memory partition support.
	  With this option a system running in an LPAR can be given more
	  memory than physically available and will allow firmware to
	  balance memory across many LPARs.

config CMM

	default y
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to enable the kernel interface
	  to reduce the memory size of the system. This is accomplished
	  by allocating pages of memory and put them "on hold". This only
	  makes sense for a system running in an LPAR where the unused pages
	  will be reused for other LPARs. The interface allows firmware to
	  balance memory across many LPARs.

config HV_PERF_CTRS
	bool "Hypervisor supplied PMU events (24x7 & GPCI)"
	default y
	depends on PERF_EVENTS && PPC_PSERIES
	help
	  Enable access to hypervisor supplied counters in perf. Currently,
	  this enables code that uses the hcall GetPerfCounterInfo and 24x7
	  interfaces to retrieve counters. GPCI exists on Power 6 and later
	  systems. 24x7 is available on Power 8 and later systems.

	 There are certain POWER platforms which support secure guests using
	 the Protected Execution Facility, with the help of an Ultravisor
	 executing below the hypervisor layer. This enables support for
	 those guests.

	 If unsure, say "N".
