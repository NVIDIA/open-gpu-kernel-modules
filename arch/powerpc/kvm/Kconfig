	help
	  Support running unmodified book3s_64 guest kernels in

	  hypervisor mode available to the host.

	  If you say Y here, KVM will use the hardware virtualization
	  facilities of POWER7 (and later) processors, meaning that
	  guest operating systems will run at full hardware speed
	  using supervisor and user modes.  However, this also means
	  that KVM is not usable under PowerVM (pHyp), is only usable
	  on POWER7 or later processors, and cannot emulate a
	  different processor from the host processor.

	help
	  Support running guest kernels in virtual machines on processors
	  without using hypervisor mode in the host, by running the
	  guest in user mode (problem state) and emulating all
	  privileged instructions and registers.

	  This is not as fast as using hypervisor mode, but works on
	  machines where hypervisor mode is not available or not usable,
	  and can emulate processors that are different from the host
	  processor, including emulating 32-bit processors on a 64-bit
	  host.

	  together with the number of executions are reported in debugfs in
