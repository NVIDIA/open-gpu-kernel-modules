/*
 * kvmppc_realmode_hmi_handler() is called only by primary thread during
 * guest exit path.
 *
 * There are multiple reasons why HMI could occur, one of them is
 * Timebase (TB) error. If this HMI is due to TB error, then TB would
 * have been in stopped state. The opal hmi handler Will fix it and
 * restore the TB value with host timebase value. For HMI caused due
 * to non-TB errors, opal hmi handler will not touch/restore TB register
 * and hence there won't be any change in TB value.
 *
 * Since we are not sure about the cause of this HMI, we can't be sure
 * about the content of TB register whether it holds guest or host timebase
 * value. Hence the idea is to resync the TB on every HMI, so that we
 * know about the exact state of the TB value. Resync TB call will
 * restore TB to host timebase.
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - On TB error, HMI interrupt is reported on all the threads of the core
 *   that has encountered TB error irrespective of split-core mode.
 * - The very first thread on the core that get chance to fix TB error
 *   would rsync the TB with local chipTOD value.
 * - The resync TB is a core level action i.e. it will sync all the TBs
 *   in that core independent of split-core mode. This means if we trigger
 *   TB sync from a thread from one subcore, it would affect TB values of
 *   sibling subcores of the same core.
 *
 * All threads need to co-ordinate before making opal hmi handler.
 * All threads will use sibling_subcore_state->in_guest[] (shared by all
 * threads in the core) in paca which holds information about whether
 * sibling subcores are in Guest mode or host mode. The in_guest[] array
 * is of size MAX_SUBCORE_PER_CORE=4, indexed using subcore id to set/unset
 * subcore status. Only primary threads from each subcore is responsible
 * to set/unset its designated array element while entering/exiting the
 * guset.
 *
 * After invoking opal hmi handler call, one of the thread (of entire core)
 * will need to resync the TB. Bit 63 from subcore state bitmap flags
 * (sibling_subcore_state->flags) will be used to co-ordinate between
 * primary threads to decide who takes up the responsibility.
 *
 * This is what we do:
 * - Primary thread from each subcore tries to set resync required bit[63]
 *   of paca->sibling_subcore_state->flags.
 * - The first primary thread that is able to set the flag takes the
 *   responsibility of TB resync. (Let us call it as thread leader)
 * - All other threads which are in host will call
 *   wait_for_subcore_guest_exit() and wait for in_guest[0-3] from
 *   paca->sibling_subcore_state to get cleared.
 * - All the primary thread will clear its subcore status from subcore
 *   state in_guest[] array respectively.
 * - Once all primary threads clear in_guest[0-3], all of them will invoke
 *   opal hmi handler.
 * - Now all threads will wait for TB resync to complete by invoking
 *   wait_for_tb_resync() except the thread leader.
 * - Thread leader will do a TB resync by invoking opal_resync_timebase()
 *   call and the it will clear the resync required bit.
 * - All other threads will now come out of resync wait loop and proceed
 *   with individual execution.
 * - On return of this function, primary thread will signal all
 *   secondary threads to proceed.
 * - All secondary threads will eventually call opal hmi handler on
 *   their exit path.
 *
 * Returns 1 if the timebase offset should be applied, 0 if not.
