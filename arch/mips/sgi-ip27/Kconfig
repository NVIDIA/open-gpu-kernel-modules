	  The nodes of Origin, Onyx, Fuel and Tezro systems can be configured
	  in either N-Modes which allows for more nodes or M-Mode which allows
	  for more memory.  Your hardware is almost certainly running in
	  M-Mode, so choose M-mode here.

	help
	  Change the way a Linux kernel is loaded into memory on a MIPS64
	  machine.  This is required in order to support text replication on
	  NUMA.  If you need to understand it, read the source code.

	  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel text across multiple
	  nodes in a NUMA cluster.  This trades memory for speed.
