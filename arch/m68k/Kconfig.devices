	help
	  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
	  behavior is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
	  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.

# We have a dedicated heartbeat LED. :-)
config PROC_HARDWARE
	bool "/proc/hardware support"
	help
	  Say Y here to support the /proc/hardware file, which gives you
	  access to information about the machine you're running on,
	  including the model, CPU, MMU, clock speed, BogoMIPS rating,
	  and memory size.

config NATFEAT
	bool "ARAnyM emulator support"
	depends on ATARI
	help
	  This option enables support for ARAnyM native features, such as
	  access to a disk image as /dev/hda.

config NFBLOCK
	tristate "NatFeat block device support"
	depends on BLOCK && NATFEAT
	help
	  Say Y to include support for the ARAnyM NatFeat block device
	  which allows direct access to the hard drives without using
	  the hardware emulation.

config NFCON
	tristate "NatFeat console driver"
	depends on TTY && NATFEAT
	help
	  Say Y to include support for the ARAnyM NatFeat console driver
	  which allows the console output to be redirected to the stderr
	  output of ARAnyM.

config NFETH
	tristate "NatFeat Ethernet support"
	depends on ETHERNET && NATFEAT
	help
	  Say Y to include support for the ARAnyM NatFeat network device
	  which will emulate a regular ethernet device while presenting an
	  ethertap device to the host system.

config ATARI_ETHERNAT
	bool "Atari EtherNAT Ethernet support"
	depends on ATARI
	help
	  Say Y to include support for the EtherNAT network adapter for the
	  CT/60 extension port.

	  To compile the actual ethernet driver, choose Y or M for the SMC91X
	  option in the network device section; the module will be called smc91x.

config ATARI_ETHERNEC
	bool "Atari EtherNEC Ethernet support"
	depends on ATARI_ROM_ISA
	help
	  Say Y to include support for the EtherNEC network adapter for the
	  ROM port. The driver works by polling instead of interrupts, so it
	  is quite slow.

	  This driver also supports the ethernet part of the NetUSBee ROM
	  port combined Ethernet/USB adapter.

	  To compile the actual ethernet driver, choose Y or M in for the NE2000
	  option in the network device section; the module will be called ne.

config ATARI_DSP56K

	help
	  If you want to be able to use the DSP56001 in Falcons, say Y. This
	  driver is still experimental, and if you don't know what it is, or
	  if you don't have this processor, just say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config AMIGA_BUILTIN_SERIAL

	  If you want to use your Amiga's built-in serial port in Linux,
	  answer Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config HPDCA

config HPAPCI

config SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for serial port console"
	depends on AMIGA_BUILTIN_SERIAL=y
	help
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader about how to pass options to the kernel at boot
	  time.)

	  If you don't have a graphical console and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  If unsure, say N.
