CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE:
---------------------------

1) "movep" emulation where data was being read from memory
was reading the intermediate bytes. Emulation now only
reads the required bytes.

2) "flogn", "flog2", and "flog10" of "1" was setting the
Inexact FPSR bit. Emulation now does not set Inexact for
this case.

3) For an opclass three FP instruction where the effective addressing
mode was pre-decrement or post-increment and the address register
was A0 or A1, the address register was not being updated as a result
of the operation. This has been corrected.

4) Beta B.2 version had the following erratum:

	Scenario:
	---------
	If {i,d}mem_{read,write}_{byte,word,long}() returns
	a failing value to the 68060SP, the package ignores
	this return value and continues with program execution
	as if it never received a failing value.

	Effect:
	-------
	For example, if a user executed "fsin.x ADDR,fp0" where
	ADDR should cause a "segmentation violation", the memory read
	requested by the package should return a failing value
	to the package. Since the package currently ignores this
	return value, the user program will continue to the
	next instruction, and the result created in fp0 will be
	undefined.

	Fix:
	----
	This has been fixed in the current release.

	Notes:
	------
	Upon receiving a non-zero (failing) return value from
	a {i,d}mem_{read,write}_{byte,word,long}() "call-out",
	the package creates a 16-byte access error stack frame
	from the current exception stack frame and exits
	through the "call-out" _real_access(). This is the process
	as described in the MC68060 User's Manual.

	For instruction read access errors, the info stacked is:
		SR	= SR at time of exception
		PC	= PC of instruction being emulated
		VOFF	= $4008 (stack frame format type)
		ADDRESS	= PC of instruction being emulated
		FSLW	= FAULT STATUS LONGWORD

	The valid FSLW bits are:
		bit 27		= 1	(misaligned bit)
		bit 24		= 1	(read)
		bit 23		= 0	(write)
		bit 22:21	= 10	(SIZE = word)
		bit 20:19	= 00	(TT)
		bit 18:16	= x10	(TM; x = 1 for supervisor mode)
		bit 15		= 1	(IO)
		bit 0		= 1	(Software Emulation Error)

	all other bits are EQUAL TO ZERO and can be set by the _real_access()
	"call-out" stub by the user as appropriate. The MC68060 User's Manual
	stated that ONLY "bit 0" would be set. The 060SP attempts to set a few
	other bits.

	For data read/write access errors, the info stacked is:
		SR	= SR at time of exception
		PC	= PC of instruction being emulated
		VOFF	= $4008 (stack frame format type)
		ADDRESS	= Address of source or destination operand
		FSLW	= FAULT STATUS LONGWORD

	The valid FSLW bits are:
		bit 27		= 0	(misaligned bit)
		bit 24		= x	(read; 1 if read, 0 if write)
		bit 23		= x	(write; 1 if write, 0 if read)
		bit 22:21	= xx	(SIZE; see MC68060 User's Manual)
		bit 20:19	= 00	(TT)
		bit 18:16	= x01	(TM; x = 1 for supervisor mode)
		bit 15		= 0	(IO)
		bit 0		= 1	(Software Emulation Error)

	all other bits are EQUAL TO ZERO and can be set by the _real_access()
	"call-out" stub by the user as appropriate. The MC68060 User's Manual
	stated that ONLY "bit 0" would be set. The 060SP attempts to set a few
	other bits.
