 *
 * ASID  - [0, TLB_NR_DYN_ASIDS-1]
 *         the canonical identifier for an mm
 *
 * kPCID - [1, TLB_NR_DYN_ASIDS]
 *         the value we write into the PCID part of CR3; corresponds to the

 *
 * uPCID - [2048 + 1, 2048 + TLB_NR_DYN_ASIDS]
 *         for KPTI each mm has two address spaces and thus needs two

	 * going to need to flush in the very near future, so we might
	 * as well get it over with.
	 *
	 * The only question is whether to do a full or partial flush.
	 *
	 * We do a partial flush if requested and two extra conditions
	 * are met:
	 *
	 * 1. f->new_tlb_gen == local_tlb_gen + 1.  We have an invariant that
	 *    we've always done all needed flushes to catch up to
	 *    local_tlb_gen.  If, for example, local_tlb_gen == 2 and
	 *    f->new_tlb_gen == 3, then we know that the flush needed to bring
	 *    us up to date for tlb_gen 3 is the partial flush we're
	 *    processing.
	 *
	 *    As an example of why this check is needed, suppose that there
	 *    are two concurrent flushes.  The first is a full flush that
	 *    changes context.tlb_gen from 1 to 2.  The second is a partial
	 *    flush that changes context.tlb_gen from 2 to 3.  If they get
	 *    processed on this CPU in reverse order, we'll see
	 *     local_tlb_gen == 1, mm_tlb_gen == 3, and end != TLB_FLUSH_ALL.
	 *    If we were to use __flush_tlb_one_user() and set local_tlb_gen to
	 *    3, we'd be break the invariant: we'd update local_tlb_gen above
	 *    1 without the full flush that's needed for tlb_gen 2.
	 *
	 * 2. f->new_tlb_gen == mm_tlb_gen.  This is purely an optimization.
	 *    Partial TLB flushes are not all that much cheaper than full TLB
	 *    flushes, so it seems unlikely that it would be a performance win
	 *    to do a partial flush if that won't bring our TLB fully up to
	 *    date.  By doing a full flush instead, we can increase
	 *    local_tlb_gen all the way to mm_tlb_gen and we can probably
	 *    avoid another flush in the very near future.
