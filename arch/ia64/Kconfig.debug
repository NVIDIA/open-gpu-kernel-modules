	  IA-64 identity-mapped regions use a large page size called "granules".

	  Select "16MB" for a small granule size.

config IA64_PRINT_HAZARDS
	bool "Print possible IA-64 dependency violations to console"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option prints more information for Illegal Dependency
	  Faults, that is, for Read-after-Write (RAW), Write-after-Write (WAW),
	  or Write-after-Read (WAR) violations.  This option is ignored if you
	  are compiling for an Itanium A step processor
	  (CONFIG_ITANIUM_ASTEP_SPECIFIC).  If you're unsure, select Y.

config DISABLE_VHPT
	bool "Disable VHPT"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  The Virtual Hash Page Table (VHPT) enhances virtual address
	  translation performance.  Normally you want the VHPT active but you
	  can select this option to disable the VHPT for debugging.  If you're
	  unsure, answer N.

config IA64_DEBUG_CMPXCHG
	bool "Turn on compare-and-exchange bug checking (slow!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA-64
	  compare-and-exchange instructions.  This is slow!  Itaniums
	  from step B3 or later don't have this problem. If you're unsure,
	  select N.

config IA64_DEBUG_IRQ
	bool "Turn on irq debug checks (slow!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA-64 irq_save
	  and restore instructions.  It's useful for tracking down spinlock
	  problems, but slow!  If you're unsure, select N.
