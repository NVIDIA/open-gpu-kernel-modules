 * 4) clear the flag.
 * 5) Wait for any running NMIs to finish.
 *
 * If an NMI is executed, the first thing it does is to call
 * "ftrace_nmi_enter". This will check if the flag is set to write
 * and if it is, it will write what is in the IP and "code" buffers.
 *
 * The trick is, it does not matter if everyone is writing the same
 * content to the code location. Also, if a CPU is executing code
 * it is OK to write to that code location if the contents being written
