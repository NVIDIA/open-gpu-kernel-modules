	help
	  If you enable this option, a subdirectory inside /proc called
	  /proc/srm_environment will give you access to the all important
	  SRM environment variables (those which have a name) and also
	  to all others (by their internal number).

	  SRM is something like a BIOS for Alpha machines. There are some
	  other such BIOSes, like AlphaBIOS, which this driver cannot
	  support (hey, that's not SRM!).

	  Despite the fact that this driver doesn't work on all Alphas (but
	  only on those which have SRM as their firmware), it's save to
	  build it even if your particular machine doesn't know about SRM
	  (or if you intend to compile a generic kernel). It will simply
	  not create those subdirectory in /proc (and give you some warning,
	  of course).

	  This driver is also available as a module and will be called
	  srm_env then.
