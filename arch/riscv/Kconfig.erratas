config RISCV_ERRATA_ALTERNATIVE
	bool "RISC-V alternative scheme"
	default y
	help
	  This Kconfig allows the kernel to automatically patch the
	  errata required by the execution platform at run time. The
	  code patching is performed once in the boot stages. It means
	  that the overhead from this mechanism is just taken once.

config ERRATA_SIFIVE
	bool "SiFive errata"
	depends on RISCV_ERRATA_ALTERNATIVE
	help
	  All SiFive errata Kconfig depend on this Kconfig. Disabling
	  this Kconfig will disable all SiFive errata. Please say "Y"
	  here if your platform uses SiFive CPU cores.

	  Otherwise, please say "N" here to avoid unnecessary overhead.

config ERRATA_SIFIVE_CIP_453
	bool "Apply SiFive errata CIP-453"
	depends on ERRATA_SIFIVE && 64BIT
	default y
	help
	  This will apply the SiFive CIP-453 errata to add sign extension
	  to the $badaddr when exception type is instruction page fault
	  and instruction access fault.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say "Y".

config ERRATA_SIFIVE_CIP_1200
	bool "Apply SiFive errata CIP-1200"
	depends on ERRATA_SIFIVE && 64BIT
	default y
	help
	  This will apply the SiFive CIP-1200 errata to repalce all
	  "sfence.vma addr" with "sfence.vma" to ensure that the addr
	  has been flushed from TLB.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say "Y".
