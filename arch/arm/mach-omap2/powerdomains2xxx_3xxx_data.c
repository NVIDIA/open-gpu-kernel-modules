/*
 * The names for the DSP/IVA2 powerdomains are confusing.
 *
 * Most OMAP chips have an on-board DSP.
 *
 * On the 2420, this is a 'C55 DSP called, simply, the DSP.  Its
 * powerdomain is called the "DSP power domain."  On the 2430, the
 * on-board DSP is a 'C64 DSP, now called (along with its hardware
 * accelerators) the IVA2 or IVA2.1.  Its powerdomain is still called
 * the "DSP power domain." On the 3430, the DSP is a 'C64 DSP like the
 * 2430, also known as the IVA2; but its powerdomain is now called the
 * "IVA2 power domain."
 *
 * The 2420 also has something called the IVA, which is a separate ARM
 * core, and has nothing to do with the DSP/IVA2.
 *
 * Ideally the DSP/IVA2 could just be the same powerdomain, but the PRCM
 * address offset is different between the C55 and C64 DSPs.
