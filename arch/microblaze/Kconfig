	help
	  The address space of Microblaze processors is only 4 Gigabytes large
	  and it has to accommodate user address space, kernel address
	  space as well as some memory mapped IO. That means that, if you
	  have a large amount of physical memory and/or IO, not all of the
	  memory can be "permanently mapped" by the kernel. The physical
	  memory that is not permanently mapped is called "high memory".

	  If unsure, say n.

	depends on ADVANCED_OPTIONS
	help
	  This option allows you to set the maximum amount of memory which
	  will be used as "low memory", that is, memory which the kernel can
	  access directly, without having to set up a kernel virtual mapping.
	  This can be useful in optimizing the layout of kernel virtual
	  memory.

	  address 0x0.
	  If non-zero, a jump instruction to this address, will be written

	  If you are unsure, set it to default value 0x0.
