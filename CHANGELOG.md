### [525.53] 2022-11-10

#### Changed

- GSP firmware is now distributed as multiple firmware files: this release has `gsp_tu10x.bin` and `gsp_ad10x.bin` replacing `gsp.bin` from previous releases.
    - Each file is named after a GPU architecture and supports GPUs from one or more architectures. This allows GSP firmware to better leverage each architecture's capabilities.
    - The .run installer will continue to install firmware to `/lib/firmware/nvidia/<version>` and the `nvidia.ko` kernel module will load the appropriate firmware for each GPU at runtime.
