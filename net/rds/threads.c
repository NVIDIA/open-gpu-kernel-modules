/*
 * All of connection management is simplified by serializing it through
 * work queues that execute in a connection managing thread.
 *
 * TCP wants to send acks through sendpage() in response to data_ready(),
 * but it needs a process context to do so.
 *
 * The receive paths need to allocate but can't drop packets (!) so we have
 * a thread around to block allocating if the receive fast path sees an
 * allocation failure.
 */

/* Grand Unified Theory of connection life cycle:
 * At any point in time, the connection can be in one of these states:
 * DOWN, CONNECTING, UP, DISCONNECTING, ERROR
 *
 * The following transitions are possible:
 *  ANY		  -> ERROR
 *  UP		  -> DISCONNECTING
 *  ERROR	  -> DISCONNECTING
 *  DISCONNECTING -> DOWN
 *  DOWN	  -> CONNECTING
 *  CONNECTING	  -> UP
 *
 * Transition to state DISCONNECTING/DOWN:
 *  -	Inside the shutdown worker; synchronizes with xmit path
 *	through RDS_IN_XMIT, and with connection management callbacks
 *	via c_cm_lock.
 *
 *	For receive callbacks, we rely on the underlying transport
 *	(TCP, IB/RDMA) to provide the necessary synchronisation.

 * This random exponential backoff is relied on to eventually resolve racing

 * the backoff range will be so much greater than the time it takes to
 * establish a connection that one of the pair will establish the connection
 * before the other's random delay fires.

 * Connection attempts that arrive while a connection is already established
 * are also considered to be racing connects.  This lets a connection from
