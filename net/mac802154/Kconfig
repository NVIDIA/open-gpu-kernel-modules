	  This option enables the hardware independent IEEE 802.15.4
	  networking stack for SoftMAC devices (the ones implementing
	  only PHY level of IEEE 802.15.4 standard).

	  Note: this implementation is neither certified, nor feature
	  complete! Compatibility with other implementations hasn't
	  been tested yet!

	  If you plan to use HardMAC IEEE 802.15.4 devices, you can
	  say N here. Alternatively you can say M to compile it as
	  module.
