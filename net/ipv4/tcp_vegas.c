 * TCP Vegas congestion control
 *
 * This is based on the congestion detection/avoidance scheme described in
 *    Lawrence S. Brakmo and Larry L. Peterson.
 *    "TCP Vegas: End to end congestion avoidance on a global internet."
 *    IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communication, 13(8):1465--1480,
 *    October 1995. Available from:
 *	ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/xkernel/Papers/jsac.ps
 *
 * See http://www.cs.arizona.edu/xkernel/ for their implementation.
 * The main aspects that distinguish this implementation from the
 * Arizona Vegas implementation are:
 *   o We do not change the loss detection or recovery mechanisms of
 *     Linux in any way. Linux already recovers from losses quite well,
 *     using fine-grained timers, NewReno, and FACK.
 *   o To avoid the performance penalty imposed by increasing cwnd
 *     only every-other RTT during slow start, we increase during
 *     every RTT during slow start, just like Reno.
 *   o Largely to allow continuous cwnd growth during slow start,
 *     we use the rate at which ACKs come back as the "actual"
 *     rate, rather than the rate at which data is sent.
 *   o To speed convergence to the right rate, we set the cwnd
 *     to achieve the right ("actual") rate when we exit slow start.
 *   o To filter out the noise caused by delayed ACKs, we use the
 *     minimum RTT sample observed during the last RTT to calculate
 *     the actual rate.
 *   o When the sender re-starts from idle, it waits until it has
 *     received ACKs for an entire flight of new data before making
 *     a cwnd adjustment decision. The original Vegas implementation
 *     assumed senders never went idle.

 * stale.
