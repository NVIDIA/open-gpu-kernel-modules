	  Intel hardware has a feature called 'silent stream', that
	  keeps external HDMI receiver's analog circuitry powered on
	  avoiding 2-3 sec silence during playback start. This mechanism
	  relies on setting channel_id as 0xf, sending info packet and
	  preventing codec D3 entry (increasing  platform static power
	  consumption when HDMI receiver is plugged-in). 2-3 sec silence
	  at the playback start is expected whenever there is format change.
	  (default is 2 channel format).
	  Say Y to enable Silent Stream feature.
