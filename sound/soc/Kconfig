	  If you want ASoC support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your SoC platform below.
	  
	  ASoC provides power efficient ALSA support for embedded battery powered
	  SoC based systems like PDA's, Phones and Personal Media Players.

	  This ASoC audio support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snd-soc-core.

	  If you want to perform tests on ALSA SoC topology support say Y here.

	  This builds a module which can be later manually loaded to run KUNIT
	  test cases against soc-topology.c API. This should be primarily used
	  by developers to test their changes to ASoC.

	  Do note that it creates fake playback devices which do not interact
	  well with userspace. When running tests one may want to disable
	  userspace applications such as pulseaudio, to prevent unnecessary
	  problems.
