 * GPU dynamic power state machine.
 *
 * The GPU is in exactly one of these states at at time.  Only certain state
 * transitions are valid, as documented by the DAGs below.
 *
 * When in "instant idle" or COARSE mode:
 *
 *                   +----------------------+
 *                   v                      |
 * +---------+     +----------------+     +--------+
 * | UNKNOWN | --> | IDLE_INDICATED | --> | IN_USE |
 * +---------+     +----------------+     +--------+
 *
 * The transition from UNKNOWN to IDLE_INDICATED happens in
 * rm_init_dynamic_power_management().
 *
 * Thereafter, transitions from IDLE_INDICATED to IN_USE happen when
 * os_ref_dynamic_power() is called and the refcount transitions from 0 to 1;
 * transitions from IN_USE to IDLE_INDICATED happen when
 * os_unref_dynamic_power() is called and the refcount transitions from 1 to 0.
 * Note that only calls to os_(un)ref_dynamic_power() with the mode == COARSE
 * are considered in this mode; calls with mode == FINE are ignored.  Since
 * COARSE calls are placed only in rm_init_adapter/rm_shutdown_adapter, the GPU
 * effectively stays in the IN_USE state any time any client has initialized
 * it.
 *
 *
 * When in "deferred idle" or FINE mode:

 *
 * As before, the transition from UNKNOWN to IDLE_INDICATED happens in
 * rm_init_dynamic_power_management().  This is not ideal: it means the GPU may
 * be powered down immediately upon loading the RM module, even if
 * rm_init_adapter() is going to be called soon thereafter.  However, we can't
 * rely on deferred idle callbacks yet, since those currently rely on core RM
 * being initialized.
 *
 * At the beginning of rm_init_adapter(), the GPU transitions to the IN_USE
 * state; during the rm_init_adapter() sequence,
 * RmInitDeferredDynamicPowerManagement() will be called which will schedule
 * timer callbacks and set the "deferred_idle_enabled" boolean.
 *
 * While in "deferred idle" mode, one of the callbacks
 * timerCallbackForIdlePreConditions(), timerCallbackToIndicateIdle(), or
 * RmIndicateIdle() should be scheduled when in the states:
 * - IN_USE
 * - IDLE_INSTANT
 * - IDLE_SUSTAINED
 * Note that since we may transition from IN_USE to IDLE_INSTANT rapidly (e.g.,
 * for a series of RM calls), we don't attempt to schedule the callbacks and
 * cancel them on each of these transitions.  The
 * timerCallbackForIdlePreConditions() callback will simply exit early if in
 * the IN_USE state.
 *
 * As before, the GPU will remain in the IN_USE state until
 * os_unref_dynamic_power() is called and the count transitions from 1 to 0
 * (calls with mode == FINE are honored, in this mode, and these transitions
 * can happen frequently).  When the refcount reaches 0, rather than going
 * directly to the IDLE_INDICATED state, it transitions to the IDLE_INSTANT
 * state.
 *
 * Then, when the next timerCallbackForIdlePreConditions() callback executes,
 * if all preconditions are met, the state will transition to IDLE_SUSTAINED.
 *
 * If, when in the IDLE_SUSTAINED state, os_ref_dynamic_power() is called, the
 * GPU will transition back to the IN_USE state and return to the IDLE_INSTANT
 * state.  This ensures that there is a suitable delay between any activity
 * that requires bumping the refcount and indicating idleness.
 *
 * If the timerCallbackForIdlePreConditions() callback executes again and the
 * GPU is still in the IDLE_SUSTAINED state, userspace mappings will be revoked
 * and the timerCallbackToIndicateIdle() callback will be scheduled.
 *
 * If, before the timerCallbackToIndicateIdle() callback executes, either
 * os_ref_dynamic_power() is called or a mapping which has been revoked is
 * accessed (which triggers the RmForceGpuNotIdle() callback), the GPU will
 * transition back to the IN_USE or IDLE_INSTANT state, respectively.
 *
 * Then, when the timerCallbackToIndicateIdle() callback executes, if all
 * mappings are still revoked, and the GPU is still in the IDLE_SUSTAINED
 * state, and all GPU idleness preconditions remain satisfied, the
 * RmIndicateIdle() work item will be enqueued.  (Else, the GPU will transition
 * back to the IDLE_INSTANT state and the callback for preconditions is
 * scheduled again.)
 *
 * Finally, once the RmIndicateIdle() work item is called, if all of the same
 * conditions still hold, the state will transition to IDLE_INDICATED.  No
 * callbacks will be scheduled from here; the callbacks for preconditions
 * should be re-scheduled when transitioning out of the IDLE_INDICATED state.
 *
 * Once in the IDLE_INDICATED state, the kernel is free to call the RM to
 * perform the GC6 entry sequence then turn off power to the GPU (although it
 * may not, if the audio function is being used for example).
 *
 * There are two paths to exit the IDLE_INDICATED state:
 * (a) If os_ref_dynamic_power() is called, in which case it transitions
 *     directly to the IN_USE state;
 * (b) If RmForceGpuNotIdle() is called, in which case it transitions back to
 *     the IDLE_INSTANT state.
