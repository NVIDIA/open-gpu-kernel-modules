 * @file  profiler.h
 * @brief Simple API to measure elapsed times in RM for profiling and statistics
 *
 * The primary goals of this API are to:
 *   1. Be lightweight and have little-to-no setup required (built into release bombs)
 *   2. Defer as much analysis as possible to the user of the data (keep it simple)
 *   3. Provide sub-millisecond resolution if possible (medium-high granularity)
 *
 * This is intended mainly for coarse measurements of time-critical software
 * sequences, such as GC6. For example, the measurements could be used to catch
 * major latency regressions in a particular timing module.
 *
 * For more sophisticated profiling (e.g. for prospective analysis), use of an
 * external profiling tool (e.g. xperf with ETW) is recommended instead.

 * Record containing the statistics of a single time module to be profiled
 * periodically.
 *
 * This tracks the min/max elapsed time over all the measurement
 * cycles, as well as the total elapsed time and number of cycles.
 * To calculate the average elapsed time per cycle, divide total_ns by count.
 *
 * 64-bit precision integers are used to hold nanosecond resolution
 * over long periods of time (e.g. greater than 4 seconds).
