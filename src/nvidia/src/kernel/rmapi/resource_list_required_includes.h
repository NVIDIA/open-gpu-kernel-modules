// This file must be included wherever resource_list.h is included. It provides
// declarations for types that resource_list.h may depend on while honoring
// RMCFG at the same time.
//
// We cannot include the required files right above the RS_ENTRY definitions in
// resource_list.h because resource_list.h may be included in places that don't
// allow some declarations (example typedefs in an enum).
//



//
// CORERM-3604
// A lot of declarations are in nvos.h
// These can be assumed to not require RMCFG. These should be eventually split
// into individual files and nvos.h should be deprecated.
