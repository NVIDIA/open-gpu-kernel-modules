/*!
 * @brief Returns a 64 bit mask, where all the bits set to 0 are the ones we
 * intend to leave enabled in the client shared subtree even when we disable
 * interrupts (for example, when we take the GPU lock).
 *
 * The non-replayable fault interrupt is shared with the client, and in the
 * top half of the interrupt handler, as such, we only copy fault packets from
 * the HW buffer to the appropriate SW buffers.
 *
 * The timer interrupt also does not need to be blocked by the GPU lock
 * since SWRL granular locking requires the timer interrupt to be serviced
 * outside the GPU lock.
 * Note - While we keep the timer interrupt enabled during the GPU lock,
 * we don't enable it in the PTIMER level when SWRL granular locking is disabled.
