 * Video engine's frame-buffer interface block has several slots/indices which can
 * be bound to support DMA to various surfaces in memory. This is an
 * enumeration that gives name to each index based on type of memory-aperture
 * the index is used to access.
 *
 * Traditionally, video falcons have used the 6th index for ucode, and we will
 * continue to use that to allow legacy ucode to work seamlessly.
 *
 * Note: DO NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF RM_VIDENG_DMAIDX_UCODE. That value is used by
 * both the legacy video ucode, which assumes that it will use index 6, and by
 * msdecos. Changing it will break legacy video ucode, unless it is updated to
 * reflect the new value.
