// On GA100, we need to be able to detect the case where the GPU is running at
// gen4, but the root port is at gen3. On baremetal, we just check the root
// port directly, but for passthrough root port is commonly completely hidden
// or fake. To handle this case we support the hypervisor explicitly
// communicating the speed to us through emulated config space. The
// ROOT_PORT_SPEED field follows the usual link speed encoding with the
// numerical value matching the gen speed, i.e. gen3 is 0x3.
// See bug 2927491 for more details.

// On some platforms it's beneficial to enable relaxed ordering after vetting
// it's safe to do so. To automate this process on virtualized platforms, allow
// RO to be requested through this emulated config space bit.
