 * @XZ_SINGLE:              Single-call mode. This uses less RAM than
 *                          than multi-call modes, because the LZMA2
 *                          dictionary doesn't need to be allocated as
 *                          part of the decoder state. All required data
 *                          structures are allocated at initialization,
 *                          so xz_dec_run() cannot return XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 * @XZ_PREALLOC:            Multi-call mode with preallocated LZMA2
 *                          dictionary buffer. All data structures are
 *                          allocated at initialization, so xz_dec_run()
 *                          cannot return XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 * @XZ_DYNALLOC:            Multi-call mode. The LZMA2 dictionary is
 *                          allocated once the required size has been
 *                          parsed from the stream headers. If the
 *                          allocation fails, xz_dec_run() will return
 *                          XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 *
 * It is possible to enable support only for a subset of the above
 * modes at compile time by defining XZ_DEC_SINGLE, XZ_DEC_PREALLOC,
 * or XZ_DEC_DYNALLOC. The xz_dec kernel module is always compiled
 * with support for all operation modes, but the preboot code may
 * be built with fewer features to minimize code size.

/**
 * enum xz_ret - Return codes
 * @XZ_OK:                  Everything is OK so far. More input or more
 *                          output space is required to continue. This

 *                          (XZ_PREALLOC or XZ_DYNALLOC).
 * @XZ_STREAM_END:          Operation finished successfully.
 * @XZ_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK:   Integrity check type is not supported. Decoding
 *                          is still possible in multi-call mode by simply
 *                          calling xz_dec_run() again.
 *                          Note that this return value is used only if
 *                          XZ_DEC_ANY_CHECK was defined at build time,
 *                          which is not used in the kernel. Unsupported
 *                          check types return XZ_OPTIONS_ERROR if
 *                          XZ_DEC_ANY_CHECK was not defined at build time.
 * @XZ_MEM_ERROR:           Allocating memory failed. This return code is
 *                          possible only if the decoder was initialized
 *                          with XZ_DYNALLOC. The amount of memory that was
 *                          tried to be allocated was no more than the
 *                          dict_max argument given to xz_dec_init().
 * @XZ_MEMLIMIT_ERROR:      A bigger LZMA2 dictionary would be needed than
 *                          allowed by the dict_max argument given to
 *                          xz_dec_init(). This return value is possible
 *                          only in multi-call mode (XZ_PREALLOC or
 *                          XZ_DYNALLOC); the single-call mode (XZ_SINGLE)
 *                          ignores the dict_max argument.
 * @XZ_FORMAT_ERROR:        File format was not recognized (wrong magic
 *                          bytes).
 * @XZ_OPTIONS_ERROR:       This implementation doesn't support the requested
 *                          compression options. In the decoder this means
 *                          that the header CRC32 matches, but the header
 *                          itself specifies something that we don't support.
 * @XZ_DATA_ERROR:          Compressed data is corrupt.
 * @XZ_BUF_ERROR:           Cannot make any progress. Details are slightly
 *                          different between multi-call and single-call
 *                          mode; more information below.
 *
 * In multi-call mode, XZ_BUF_ERROR is returned when two consecutive calls
 * to XZ code cannot consume any input and cannot produce any new output.
 * This happens when there is no new input available, or the output buffer
 * is full while at least one output byte is still pending. Assuming your
 * code is not buggy, you can get this error only when decoding a compressed
 * stream that is truncated or otherwise corrupt.
 *
 * In single-call mode, XZ_BUF_ERROR is returned only when the output buffer
 * is too small or the compressed input is corrupt in a way that makes the
 * decoder produce more output than the caller expected. When it is
 * (relatively) clear that the compressed input is truncated, XZ_DATA_ERROR
 * is used instead of XZ_BUF_ERROR.

 * @mode:       Operation mode
 * @dict_max:   Maximum size of the LZMA2 dictionary (history buffer) for
 *              multi-call decoding. This is ignored in single-call mode
 *              (mode == XZ_SINGLE). LZMA2 dictionary is always 2^n bytes
 *              or 2^n + 2^(n-1) bytes (the latter sizes are less common
 *              in practice), so other values for dict_max don't make sense.
 *              In the kernel, dictionary sizes of 64 KiB, 128 KiB, 256 KiB,
 *              512 KiB, and 1 MiB are probably the only reasonable values,
 *              except for kernel and initramfs images where a bigger
 *              dictionary can be fine and useful.
 *
 * Single-call mode (XZ_SINGLE): xz_dec_run() decodes the whole stream at
 * once. The caller must provide enough output space or the decoding will
 * fail. The output space is used as the dictionary buffer, which is why
 * there is no need to allocate the dictionary as part of the decoder's
 * internal state.
 *
 * Because the output buffer is used as the workspace, streams encoded using
 * a big dictionary are not a problem in single-call mode. It is enough that
 * the output buffer is big enough to hold the actual uncompressed data; it
 * can be smaller than the dictionary size stored in the stream headers.
 *
 * Multi-call mode with preallocated dictionary (XZ_PREALLOC): dict_max bytes
 * of memory is preallocated for the LZMA2 dictionary. This way there is no
 * risk that xz_dec_run() could run out of memory, since xz_dec_run() will
 * never allocate any memory. Instead, if the preallocated dictionary is too
 * small for decoding the given input stream, xz_dec_run() will return
 * XZ_MEMLIMIT_ERROR. Thus, it is important to know what kind of data will be
 * decoded to avoid allocating excessive amount of memory for the dictionary.
 *
 * Multi-call mode with dynamically allocated dictionary (XZ_DYNALLOC):
 * dict_max specifies the maximum allowed dictionary size that xz_dec_run()
 * may allocate once it has parsed the dictionary size from the stream
 * headers. This way excessive allocations can be avoided while still
 * limiting the maximum memory usage to a sane value to prevent running the
 * system out of memory when decompressing streams from untrusted sources.
 *
 * On success, xz_dec_init() returns a pointer to struct xz_dec, which is
 * ready to be used with xz_dec_run(). If memory allocation fails,
 * xz_dec_init() returns NULL.
