 * \brief           This function performs GCM encryption or decryption of a buffer.

 *                  buffer must trail at least 8 Bytes behind the input buffer.
 *
 * \warning         When this function performs a decryption, it outputs the
 *                  authentication tag and does not verify that the data is
 *                  authentic. You should use this function to perform encryption
 *                  only. For decryption, use mbedtls_gcm_auth_decrypt() instead.
 *
 * \param ctx       The GCM context to use for encryption or decryption. This

 *                  - #MBEDTLS_GCM_ENCRYPT to perform authenticated encryption.
 *                    The ciphertext is written to \p output and the
 *                    authentication tag is written to \p tag.
 *                  - #MBEDTLS_GCM_DECRYPT to perform decryption.
 *                    The plaintext is written to \p output and the
 *                    authentication tag is written to \p tag.
 *                    Note that this mode is not recommended, because it does
 *                    not verify the authenticity of the data. For this reason,
 *                    you should use mbedtls_gcm_auth_decrypt() instead of
 *                    calling this function in decryption mode.
 * \param length    The length of the input data, which is equal to the length
 *                  of the output data.
 * \param iv        The initialization vector. This must be a readable buffer of
 *                  at least \p iv_len Bytes.
 * \param iv_len    The length of the IV.
 * \param add       The buffer holding the additional data. This must be of at
 *                  least that size in Bytes.
 * \param add_len   The length of the additional data.
 * \param input     The buffer holding the input data. If \p length is greater
 *                  than zero, this must be a readable buffer of at least that
 *                  size in Bytes.
 * \param output    The buffer for holding the output data. If \p length is greater
 *                  than zero, this must be a writable buffer of at least that
 *                  size in Bytes.
 * \param tag_len   The length of the tag to generate.
