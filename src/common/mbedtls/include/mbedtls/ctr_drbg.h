/**
 * \file ctr_drbg.h
 *
 * \brief    This file contains definitions and functions for the
 *           CTR_DRBG pseudorandom generator.
 *
 * CTR_DRBG is a standardized way of building a PRNG from a block-cipher
 * in counter mode operation, as defined in <em>NIST SP 800-90A:
 * Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random
 * Bit Generators</em>.
 *
 * The Mbed TLS implementation of CTR_DRBG uses AES-256 (default) or AES-128
 * (if \c MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_USE_128_BIT_KEY is enabled at compile time)
 * as the underlying block cipher, with a derivation function.
 * The initial seeding grabs #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN bytes of entropy.
 * See the documentation of mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed() for more details.
 *
 * Based on NIST SP 800-90A ยง10.2.1 table 3 and NIST SP 800-57 part 1 table 2,
 * here are the security strengths achieved in typical configuration:
 * - 256 bits under the default configuration of the library, with AES-256
 *   and with #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN set to 48 or more.
 * - 256 bits if AES-256 is used, #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN is set
 *   to 32 or more, and the DRBG is initialized with an explicit
 *   nonce in the \c custom parameter to mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed().
 * - 128 bits if AES-256 is used but #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN is
 *   between 24 and 47 and the DRBG is not initialized with an explicit
 *   nonce (see mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed()).
 * - 128 bits if AES-128 is used (\c MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_USE_128_BIT_KEY enabled)
 *   and #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN is set to 24 or more (which is
 *   always the case unless it is explicitly set to a different value
 *   in config.h).
 *
 * Note that the value of #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN defaults to:
 * - \c 48 if the module \c MBEDTLS_SHA512_C is enabled and the symbol
 *   \c MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_FORCE_SHA256 is disabled at compile time.
 *   This is the default configuration of the library.
 * - \c 32 if the module \c MBEDTLS_SHA512_C is disabled at compile time.
 * - \c 32 if \c MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_FORCE_SHA256 is enabled at compile time.

 *
 * A typical choice for the \p f_entropy and \p p_entropy parameters is
 * to use the entropy module:
 * - \p f_entropy is mbedtls_entropy_func();
 * - \p p_entropy is an instance of ::mbedtls_entropy_context initialized
 *   with mbedtls_entropy_init() (which registers the platform's default
 *   entropy sources).
 *
 * The entropy length is #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN by default.
 * You can override it by calling mbedtls_ctr_drbg_set_entropy_len().
 *
 * You can provide a personalization string in addition to the
 * entropy source, to make this instantiation as unique as possible.
 *
 * \note                The _seed_material_ value passed to the derivation
 *                      function in the CTR_DRBG Instantiate Process

 *                      is the concatenation of the string obtained from
 *                      calling \p f_entropy and the \p custom string.
 *                      The origin of the nonce depends on the value of
 *                      the entropy length relative to the security strength.
 *                      - If the entropy length is at least 1.5 times the
 *                        security strength then the nonce is taken from the
 *                        string obtained with \p f_entropy.
 *                      - If the entropy length is less than the security
 *                        strength, then the nonce is taken from \p custom.
 *                        In this case, for compliance with SP 800-90A,
 *                        you must pass a unique value of \p custom at
 *                        each invocation. See SP 800-90A ยง8.6.7 for more
