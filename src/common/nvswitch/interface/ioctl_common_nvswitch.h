 *    expected the FM will send heartbeat updates.  If the heartbeat is not
 *    received before the session timeout, then the bomb reports status
 *    as MANAGER_TIMEOUT.
 *
 *    Device Fabric State reflects the state of the nvswitch device.
 *    FM sets the Device Fabric State to CONFIGURED once FM is managing the
 *    device.  If the Device Fabric State is BLACKLISTED then the device is
 *    not available for use; opens fail for a blacklisted device, and interrupts
 *    are disabled.
 *
 *    Blacklist Reason provides additional detail of why a device is blacklisted.
