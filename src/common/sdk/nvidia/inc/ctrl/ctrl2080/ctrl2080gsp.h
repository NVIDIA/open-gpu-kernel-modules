/*
 * NV2080_CTRL_CMD_GSP_GET_FEATURES
 *
 * This command is used to determine which GSP features are
 * supported on this GPU.
 *
 *   gspFeatures
 *     Bit mask that specifies GSP features supported.
 *   bValid
 *     If this field is set to NV_TRUE, then above bit mask is
 *     considered valid. Otherwise, bit mask should be ignored
 *     as invalid. bValid will be set to NV_TRUE when RM is a
 *     GSP client with GPU support offloaded to GSP firmware.
 *   bDefaultGspRmGpu
 *     If this field is set to NV_TRUE, it indicates that the
 *     underlying GPU has GSP-RM enabled by default. If set to NV_FALSE,
 *     it indicates that the GPU has GSP-RM disabled by default.
 *   firmwareVersion
 *     This field contains the buffer into which the firmware build version
 *     should be returned, if GPU is offloaded. Otherwise, the buffer
 *     will remain untouched.
 *
 * Possible status return values are:
 *   NV_OK
 *   NV_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
