 * NV0080_CTRL_CMD_BSP_GET_CAPS
 *
 * This command returns the set of BSP capabilities for the device
 * in the form of an array of unsigned bytes.  BSP capabilities
 * include supported features and required workarounds for the decoder
 * within the device, each represented by a byte offset into the
 * table and a bit position within that byte.
 *
 *   capsTblSize
 *     This parameter specifies the size in bytes of the caps table.
 *     This value should be set to NV0080_CTRL_BSP_CAPS_TBL_SIZE.
 *   capsTbl
 *     This parameter specifies a pointer to the client's caps table buffer
 *     into which the BSP caps bits will be transferred by the RM.
 *     The caps table is an array of unsigned bytes.
 *   instanceId
 *     This parameter specifies the instance Id of NVDEC for which
 *     cap bits are requested. 
 *
 * Possible status values returned are:
 *   NV_OK
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_PARAM_STRUCT
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
