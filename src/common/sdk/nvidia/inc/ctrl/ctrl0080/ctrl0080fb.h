 * NV0080_CTRL_CMD_FB_GET_CAPS
 *
 * This command returns the set of framebuffer capabilities for the device
 * in the form of an array of unsigned bytes.  Framebuffer capabilities
 * include supported features and required workarounds for the framebuffer
 * engine(s) within the device, each represented by a byte offset into the
 * table and a bit position within that byte.
 *
 *   capsTblSize
 *     This parameter specifies the size in bytes of the caps table.
 *     This value should be set to NV0080_CTRL_FB_CAPS_TBL_SIZE.
 *   capsTbl
 *     This parameter specifies a pointer to the client's caps table buffer
 *     into which the framebuffer caps bits will be transferred by the RM.
 *     The caps table is an array of unsigned bytes.
 *
 * Possible status values returned are:
 *   NV_OK
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_PARAM_STRUCT
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
 *   NV_ERR_INVALID_POINTER

 * NV0080_CTRL_CMD_FB_COMPBIT_STORE_GET_INFO
 *
 * This command returns compbit backing store-related information.
 *
 *   size
 *     [out] Size of compbit store, in bytes
 *   address
 *     [out] Address of compbit store
 *   addressSpace
 *     [out] Address space of compbit store (corresponds to type NV_ADDRESS_SPACE in nvrm.h)
 *   maxCompbitLine
 *     [out] Maximum compbitline possible, determined based on size
 *   comptagsPerCacheLine
 *     [out] Number of compression tags per compression cache line, across all
 *           L2 slices.
 *   cacheLineSize
 *     [out] Size of compression cache line, across all L2 slices. (bytes)
 *   cacheLineSizePerSlice
 *     [out] Size of the compression cache line per slice (bytes)
 *   cacheLineFetchAlignment
 *     [out] Alignment used while fetching the compression cacheline range in FB.
 *           If start offset of compcacheline in FB is S and end offset is E, then
 *           the range to fetch to ensure entire compcacheline data is extracted is:
 *           (align_down(S) , align_up(E))
 *           This is needed in GM20X+ because of interleaving of data in Linear FB space.
 *           Example - In GM204 every other 1K FB chunk of data is offset by 16K.
 *   backingStoreBase
 *     [out] Address of start of Backing Store in linear FB Physical Addr space.
 *           This is the actual offset in FB which HW starts using as the Backing Store and
 *           in general will be different from the start of the region that driver allocates
 *           as the backing store. This address is expected to be 2K aligned.
 *   gobsPerComptagPerSlice
 *     [out] (Only on Pascal) Number of GOBS(512 bytes of surface PA) that correspond to one 64KB comptgaline, per slice.
 *           One GOB stores 1 byte of compression bits.
 *           0 value means this field is not applicable for the current architecture.
 *   backingStoreCbcBase
 *     [out] 2KB aligned base address of CBC (post divide address)
 *   comptaglineAllocationPolicy
 *     [out] Policy used to allocate comptagline from CBC for the device
 *   privRegionStartOffset
 *     [out] Starting offset for any priv region allocated by clients. only used by MODS
 *   Possible status values returned are:
 *   NV_OK
