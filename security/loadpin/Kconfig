	bool "Pin load of kernel files (modules, fw, etc) to one filesystem"
	depends on SECURITY && BLOCK
	help
	  Any files read through the kernel file reading interface
	  (kernel modules, firmware, kexec images, security policy)
	  can be pinned to the first filesystem used for loading. When
	  enabled, any files that come from other filesystems will be
	  rejected. This is best used on systems without an initrd that
	  have a root filesystem backed by a read-only device such as
	  dm-verity or a CDROM.

config SECURITY_LOADPIN_ENFORCE
	bool "Enforce LoadPin at boot"
	depends on SECURITY_LOADPIN
	help
	  If selected, LoadPin will enforce pinning at boot. If not
	  selected, it can be enabled at boot with the kernel parameter
	  "loadpin.enforce=1".
