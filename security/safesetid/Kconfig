          SafeSetID is an LSM module that gates the setid family of syscalls to
          restrict UID/GID transitions from a given UID/GID to only those
          approved by a system-wide whitelist. These restrictions also prohibit
          the given UIDs/GIDs from obtaining auxiliary privileges associated
          with CAP_SET{U/G}ID, such as allowing a user to set up user namespace
          UID mappings.
