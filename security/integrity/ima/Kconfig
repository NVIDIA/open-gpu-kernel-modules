	  The Trusted Computing Group(TCG) runtime Integrity
	  Measurement Architecture(IMA) maintains a list of hash
	  values of executables and other sensitive system files,
	  as they are read or executed. If an attacker manages
	  to change the contents of an important system file
	  being measured, we can tell.

	  If your system has a TPM chip, then IMA also maintains
	  an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the
	  TPM hardware, so that the TPM can prove to a third party
	  whether or not critical system files have been modified.
	  Read <https://www.usenix.org/events/sec04/tech/sailer.html>

	   TPM PCRs are only reset on a hard reboot.  In order to validate
	   a TPM's quote after a soft boot, the IMA measurement list of the
	   running kernel must be saved and restored on boot.

	   Depending on the IMA policy, the measurement list can grow to
	   be very large.

	  IMA policy can now be updated multiple times.  The new rules get

	   It is often useful to be able to read back the IMA policy.  It is

	   This option allows the root user to see the current policy rules.

config IMA_APPRAISE

	depends on IMA
	default n
	help
	  This option enables local measurement integrity appraisal.
	  It requires the system to be labeled with a security extended
	  attribute containing the file hash measurement.  To protect
	  the security extended attributes from offline attack, enable
	  and configure EVM.

	  For more information on integrity appraisal refer to:

config IMA_APPRAISE_BUILD_POLICY

	default n
	help
	  This option defines an IMA appraisal policy at build time, which
	  is enforced at run time without having to specify a builtin
	  policy name on the boot command line.  The build time appraisal
	  policy rules persist after loading a custom policy.

	  Depending on the rules configured, this policy may require kernel
	  modules, firmware, the kexec kernel image, and/or the IMA policy
	  to be signed.  Unsigned files might prevent the system from
	  booting or applications from working properly.

config IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_FIRMWARE_SIGS
	bool "Appraise firmware signatures"
	depends on IMA_APPRAISE_BUILD_POLICY
	default n
	help
	  This option defines a policy requiring all firmware to be signed,

	  verification methods are necessary.

config IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_KEXEC_SIGS

	default n
	help
	  Enabling this rule will require all kexec'ed kernel images to
	  be signed and verified by a public key on the trusted IMA
	  keyring.

	  Kernel image signatures can not be verified by the original
	  kexec_load syscall.  Enabling this rule will prevent its
	  usage.

config IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_MODULE_SIGS
	bool "Appraise kernel modules signatures"
	depends on IMA_APPRAISE_BUILD_POLICY
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this rule will require all kernel modules to be signed
	  and verified by a public key on the trusted IMA keyring.

	  Kernel module signatures can only be verified by IMA-appraisal,
	  via the finit_module syscall. Enabling this rule will prevent
	  the usage of the init_module syscall.

config IMA_APPRAISE_REQUIRE_POLICY_SIGS
	bool "Appraise IMA policy signature"
	depends on IMA_APPRAISE_BUILD_POLICY
	default n

	  Enabling this rule will require the IMA policy to be signed and

config IMA_APPRAISE_BOOTPARAM
	bool "ima_appraise boot parameter"
	depends on IMA_APPRAISE

	   Adds support for signatures appended to files. The format of the

	  Keys may be added to the IMA or IMA blacklist keyrings, if the
	  key is validly signed by a CA cert in the system built-in or
	  secondary trusted keyrings.

	  Intermediate keys between those the kernel has compiled in and the
	  IMA keys to be added may be added to the system secondary keyring,
	  provided they are validly signed by a key already resident in the
	  built-in or secondary trusted keyrings.

	   This option creates an IMA blacklist keyring, which contains all
	   revoked IMA keys.  It is consulted before any other keyring.  If

	   an error is returned to the caller.

config IMA_LOAD_X509
	bool "Load X509 certificate onto the '.ima' trusted keyring"
	depends on IMA_TRUSTED_KEYRING
	default n
	help
	   File signature verification is based on the public keys
	   loaded on the .ima trusted keyring. These public keys are
	   X509 certificates signed by a trusted key on the
	   .system keyring.  This option enables X509 certificate
	   loading from the kernel onto the '.ima' trusted keyring.

config IMA_X509_PATH
