#
# When a Kconfig string contains a filename, it is suitable for
# passing to shell commands. It is surrounded by double-quotes, and
# any double-quotes or backslashes within it are escaped by
# backslashes.
#
# This is no use for dependencies or $(wildcard). We need to strip the
# surrounding quotes and the escaping from quotes and backslashes, and
# we *do* need to escape any spaces in the string. So, for example:
#
# Usage: $(eval $(call config_filename,FOO))
#
# Defines FOO_FILENAME based on the contents of the CONFIG_FOO option,
# transformed as described above to be suitable for use within the
# makefile.
#
# Also, if the filename is a relative filename and exists in the source
# tree but not the build tree, define FOO_SRCPREFIX as $(srctree)/ to
# be prefixed to *both* command invocation and dependencies.
#
# Note: We also print the filenames in the quiet_cmd_foo text, and
# perhaps ought to have a version specially escaped for that purpose.
# But it's only cosmetic, and $(patsubst "%",%,$(CONFIG_FOO)) is good
# enough.  It'll strip the quotes in the common case where there's no
# space and it's a simple filename, and it'll retain the quotes when
# there's a space. There are some esoteric cases in which it'll print
# the wrong thing, but we don't really care. The actual dependencies
# and commands *do* get it right, with various combinations of single
# and double quotes, backslashes and spaces in the filenames.
