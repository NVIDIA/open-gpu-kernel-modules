ksymoops has been removed from the kernel.  It was always meant to be a
free standing utility, not linked to any particular kernel version.
The latest version can be found in
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops together with patches to
other utilities in order to give more accurate Oops debugging.
