# SUBARCH tells the usermode build what the underlying arch is.  That is set
# first, and if a usermode build is happening, the "ARCH=um" on the command
# line overrides the setting of ARCH below.  If a native build is happening,
# then ARCH is assigned, getting whatever value it gets normally, and
# SUBARCH is subsequently ignored.
