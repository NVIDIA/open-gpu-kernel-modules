Thank you for all the enthusiasm around open-gpu-kernel-modules.

## Non-functional (cosmetic) changes

While we appreciate your enthusiasm, we have decided not to accept non-functional changes such as
non-code typo fixes, comment and language adjustments, whitespace changes, and similar.

Changes going into this codebase incur significant overhead. As such, we want to focus our resources
on executable code improvements for now.

If you have questions, or are unsure about the nature of your desired change, please ask us on the
[Discussion boards](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/discussions)!

## Code style

We currently do not publish a code style guide, as we have many different components coming together.
Please read the existing code in the repository, especially the one surrounding your proposed change,
to get a feel for what you should aim for.

Don't worry too much about it! We are happy to guide you through any neccessary style changes through
code review of your PR.
