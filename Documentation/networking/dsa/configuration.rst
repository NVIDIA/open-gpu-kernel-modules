DSA switch configuration from userspace
=======================================

The DSA switch configuration is not integrated into the main userspace
network configuration suites by now and has to be performed manualy.

.. _dsa-config-showcases:

Configuration showcases
-----------------------

To configure a DSA switch a couple of commands need to be executed. In this
documentation some common configuration scenarios are handled as showcases:

*single port*
  Every switch port acts as a different configurable Ethernet port

*bridge*
  Every switch port is part of one configurable Ethernet bridge

*gateway*
  Every switch port except one upstream port is part of a configurable
  Ethernet bridge.
  The upstream port acts as different configurable Ethernet port.

All configurations are performed with tools from iproute2, which is available
at https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/net/iproute2/

Through DSA every port of a switch is handled like a normal linux Ethernet
interface. The CPU port is the switch port connected to an Ethernet MAC chip.
The corresponding linux Ethernet interface is called the master interface.
All other corresponding linux interfaces are called slave interfaces.

The slave interfaces depend on the master interface being up in order for them
to send or receive traffic. Prior to kernel v5.12, the state of the master
interface had to be managed explicitly by the user. Starting with kernel v5.12,
the behavior is as follows:

- when a DSA slave interface is brought up, the master interface is
  automatically brought up.
- when the master interface is brought down, all DSA slave interfaces are
  automatically brought down.

In this documentation the following Ethernet interfaces are used:

*eth0*
  the master interface

*lan1*
  a slave interface

*lan2*
  another slave interface

*lan3*
  a third slave interface

*wan*
  A slave interface dedicated for upstream traffic

Further Ethernet interfaces can be configured similar.
The configured IPs and networks are:

*single port*
  * lan1: 192.0.2.1/30 (192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.3)
  * lan2: 192.0.2.5/30 (192.0.2.4 - 192.0.2.7)
  * lan3: 192.0.2.9/30 (192.0.2.8 - 192.0.2.11)

*bridge*
  * br0: 192.0.2.129/25 (192.0.2.128 - 192.0.2.255)

*gateway*
  * br0: 192.0.2.129/25 (192.0.2.128 - 192.0.2.255)
  * wan: 192.0.2.1/30 (192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.3)

.. _dsa-tagged-configuration:

Configuration with tagging support
----------------------------------

The tagging based configuration is desired and supported by the majority of
DSA switches. These switches are capable to tag incoming and outgoing traffic
without using a VLAN based configuration.

*single port*
  .. code-block:: sh

    # configure each interface
    ip addr add 192.0.2.1/30 dev lan1
    ip addr add 192.0.2.5/30 dev lan2
    ip addr add 192.0.2.9/30 dev lan3

    # For kernels earlier than v5.12, the master interface needs to be
    # brought up manually before the slave ports.
    ip link set eth0 up

    # bring up the slave interfaces
    ip link set lan1 up
    ip link set lan2 up
    ip link set lan3 up

*bridge*
  .. code-block:: sh

    # For kernels earlier than v5.12, the master interface needs to be
    # brought up manually before the slave ports.
    ip link set eth0 up

    # bring up the slave interfaces
    ip link set lan1 up
    ip link set lan2 up
    ip link set lan3 up

    # create bridge
    ip link add name br0 type bridge

    # add ports to bridge
    ip link set dev lan1 master br0
    ip link set dev lan2 master br0
    ip link set dev lan3 master br0

    # configure the bridge
    ip addr add 192.0.2.129/25 dev br0

    # bring up the bridge
    ip link set dev br0 up

*gateway*
  .. code-block:: sh

    # For kernels earlier than v5.12, the master interface needs to be
    # brought up manually before the slave ports.
    ip link set eth0 up

    # bring up the slave interfaces
    ip link set wan up
    ip link set lan1 up
    ip link set lan2 up

    # configure the upstream port
    ip addr add 192.0.2.1/30 dev wan

    # create bridge
    ip link add name br0 type bridge

    # add ports to bridge
    ip link set dev lan1 master br0
    ip link set dev lan2 master br0

    # configure the bridge
    ip addr add 192.0.2.129/25 dev br0

    # bring up the bridge
    ip link set dev br0 up

.. _dsa-vlan-configuration:

Configuration without tagging support
-------------------------------------

A minority of switches are not capable to use a taging protocol
(DSA_TAG_PROTO_NONE). These switches can be configured by a VLAN based
configuration.

*single port*
  The configuration can only be set up via VLAN tagging and bridge setup.

  .. code-block:: sh

    # tag traffic on CPU port
    ip link add link eth0 name eth0.1 type vlan id 1
    ip link add link eth0 name eth0.2 type vlan id 2
    ip link add link eth0 name eth0.3 type vlan id 3

    # For kernels earlier than v5.12, the master interface needs to be
    # brought up manually before the slave ports.
    ip link set eth0 up
    ip link set eth0.1 up
    ip link set eth0.2 up
    ip link set eth0.3 up

    # bring up the slave interfaces
    ip link set lan1 up
    ip link set lan2 up
    ip link set lan3 up

    # create bridge
    ip link add name br0 type bridge

    # activate VLAN filtering
    ip link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1

    # add ports to bridges
    ip link set dev lan1 master br0
    ip link set dev lan2 master br0
    ip link set dev lan3 master br0

    # tag traffic on ports
    bridge vlan add dev lan1 vid 1 pvid untagged
    bridge vlan add dev lan2 vid 2 pvid untagged
    bridge vlan add dev lan3 vid 3 pvid untagged

    # configure the VLANs
    ip addr add 192.0.2.1/30 dev eth0.1
    ip addr add 192.0.2.5/30 dev eth0.2
    ip addr add 192.0.2.9/30 dev eth0.3

    # bring up the bridge devices
    ip link set br0 up
