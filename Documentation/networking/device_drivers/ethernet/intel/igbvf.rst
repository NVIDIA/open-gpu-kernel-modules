This driver supports Intel 82576-based virtual function devices-based virtual
function devices that can only be activated on kernels that support SR-IOV.

SR-IOV requires the correct platform and OS support.

The guest OS loading this driver must support MSI-X interrupts.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use
with Linux.

Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ifconfig.
Instructions on updating ethtool can be found in the section Additional
Configurations later in this document.

NOTE: There is a limit of a total of 32 shared VLANs to 1 or more VFs.
