Digital TV Frontend API
#######################

The Digital TV frontend API was designed to support three groups of delivery
systems: Terrestrial, cable and Satellite. Currently, the following
delivery systems are supported:

-  Terrestrial systems: DVB-T, DVB-T2, ATSC, ATSC M/H, ISDB-T, DVB-H,
   DTMB, CMMB

-  Cable systems: DVB-C Annex A/C, ClearQAM (DVB-C Annex B)

-  Satellite systems: DVB-S, DVB-S2, DVB Turbo, ISDB-S, DSS

The Digital TV frontend controls several sub-devices including:

-  Tuner

-  Digital TV demodulator

-  Low noise amplifier (LNA)

-  Satellite Equipment Control (SEC) [#f1]_.

The frontend can be accessed through ``/dev/dvb/adapter?/frontend?``.
Data types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
``linux/dvb/frontend.h`` in your application.

.. note::

   Transmission via the internet (DVB-IP) and MMT (MPEG Media Transport)
   is not yet handled by this API but a future extension is possible.

   On Satellite systems, the API support for the Satellite Equipment
   Control (SEC) allows to power control and to send/receive signals to
   control the antenna subsystem, selecting the polarization and choosing
   the Intermediate Frequency IF) of the Low Noise Block Converter Feed
   Horn (LNBf). It supports the DiSEqC and V-SEC protocols. The DiSEqC
   (digital SEC) specification is available at
   `Eutelsat <http://www.eutelsat.com/satellites/4_5_5.html>`__.
