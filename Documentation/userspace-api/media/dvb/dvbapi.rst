Part II - Digital TV API
########################

.. note::

   This API is also known as Linux **DVB API**.

   It it was originally written to support the European digital TV
   standard (DVB), and later extended to support all digital TV standards.

   In order to avoid confusion, within this document, it was opted to refer to
   it, and to associated hardware as **Digital TV**.

   The word **DVB** is reserved to be used for:

     - the Digital TV API version
       (e. g. DVB API version 3 or DVB API version 5);
     - digital TV data types (enums, structs, defines, etc);
     - digital TV device nodes (``/dev/dvb/...``);
     - the European DVB standard.

**Version 5.10**
