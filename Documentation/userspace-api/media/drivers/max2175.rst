Maxim Integrated MAX2175 RF to bits tuner driver
================================================

The MAX2175 driver implements the following driver-specific controls:

``V4L2_CID_MAX2175_I2S_ENABLE``
-------------------------------
    Enable/Disable I2S output of the tuner. This is a private control
    that can be accessed only using the subdev interface.
    Refer to Documentation/driver-api/media/v4l2-controls.rst for more details.

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0
    :widths:       1 4

    * - ``(0)``
      - I2S output is disabled.
    * - ``(1)``
      - I2S output is enabled.

``V4L2_CID_MAX2175_HSLS``
-------------------------
    The high-side/low-side (HSLS) control of the tuner for a given band.

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0
    :widths:       1 4

    * - ``(0)``
      - The LO frequency position is below the desired frequency.
    * - ``(1)``
      - The LO frequency position is above the desired frequency.

``V4L2_CID_MAX2175_RX_MODE (menu)``
-----------------------------------
    The Rx mode controls a number of preset parameters of the tuner like
    sample clock (sck), sampling rate etc. These multiple settings are
    provided under one single label called Rx mode in the datasheet. The
    list below shows the supported modes with a brief description.

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0
    :widths:       1 4

    * - ``"Europe modes"``
    * - ``"FM 1.2" (0)``
      - This configures FM band with a sample rate of 0.512 million
        samples/sec with a 10.24 MHz sck.
    * - ``"DAB 1.2" (1)``
      - This configures VHF band with a sample rate of 2.048 million
        samples/sec with a 32.768 MHz sck.

    * - ``"North America modes"``
    * - ``"FM 1.0" (0)``
      - This configures FM band with a sample rate of 0.7441875 million
        samples/sec with a 14.88375 MHz sck.
    * - ``"DAB 1.2" (1)``
      - This configures FM band with a sample rate of 0.372 million
        samples/sec with a 7.441875 MHz sck.
