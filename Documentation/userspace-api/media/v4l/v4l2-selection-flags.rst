    * - Flag name

      - Definition
      - Valid for V4L2
      - Valid for V4L2 subdev
    * - ``V4L2_SEL_FLAG_GE``
      - (1 << 0)
      - Suggest the driver it should choose greater or equal rectangle (in
	size) than was requested. Albeit the driver may choose a lesser
	size, it will only do so due to hardware limitations. Without this
	flag (and ``V4L2_SEL_FLAG_LE``) the behaviour is to choose the
	closest possible rectangle.
      - Yes
      - Yes
    * - ``V4L2_SEL_FLAG_LE``
      - (1 << 1)
      - Suggest the driver it should choose lesser or equal rectangle (in
	size) than was requested. Albeit the driver may choose a greater
	size, it will only do so due to hardware limitations.
      - Yes
      - Yes
    * - ``V4L2_SEL_FLAG_KEEP_CONFIG``
      - (1 << 2)
      - The configuration must not be propagated to any further processing
	steps. If this flag is not given, the configuration is propagated
	inside the subdevice to all further processing steps.
      - No
      - Yes
