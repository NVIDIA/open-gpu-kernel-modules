      - Old 4-bit greyscale format. Only the most significant 4 bits of
	each byte are used, the other bits are set to 0.
    * .. _V4L2-PIX-FMT-Y6:

      - ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y6``
      - 'Y06 '
      - Old 6-bit greyscale format. Only the most significant 6 bits of

    * .. _V4L2-PIX-FMT-S5C-UYVY-JPG:

      - ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_S5C_UYVY_JPG``
      - 'S5CI'
      - Two-planar format used by Samsung S5C73MX cameras. The first plane
	contains interleaved JPEG and UYVY image data, followed by meta
	data in form of an array of offsets to the UYVY data blocks. The
	actual pointer array follows immediately the interleaved JPEG/UYVY
	data, the number of entries in this array equals the height of the
	UYVY image. Each entry is a 4-byte unsigned integer in big endian
	order and it's an offset to a single pixel line of the UYVY image.
	The first plane can start either with JPEG or UYVY data chunk. The
	size of a single UYVY block equals the UYVY image's width
	multiplied by 2. The size of a JPEG chunk depends on the image and
	can vary with each line.

	The second plane, at an offset of 4084 bytes, contains a 4-byte
	offset to the pointer array in the first plane. This offset is
	followed by a 4-byte value indicating size of the pointer array.
	All numbers in the second plane are also in big endian order.
	Remaining data in the second plane is undefined. The information
	in the second plane allows to easily find location of the pointer
	array, which can be different for each frame. The size of the
	pointer array is constant for given UYVY image height.

	In order to extract UYVY and JPEG frames an application can
	initially set a data pointer to the start of first plane and then
	add an offset from the first entry of the pointers table. Such a
	pointer indicates start of an UYVY image pixel line. Whole UYVY
	line can be copied to a separate buffer. These steps should be
	repeated for each line, i.e. the number of entries in the pointer
	array. Anything what's in between the UYVY lines is JPEG data and
	should be concatenated to form the JPEG stream.
    * .. _V4L2-PIX-FMT-MT21C:

      - ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_MT21C``
      - 'MT21'
      - Compressed two-planar YVU420 format used by Mediatek MT8173.
	The compression is lossless.
	It is an opaque intermediate format and the MDP hardware must be
	used to convert ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_MT21C`` to ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M``,
	``V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420M`` or ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVU420``.
    * .. _V4L2-PIX-FMT-SUNXI-TILED-NV12:

      - ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_SUNXI_TILED_NV12``
      - 'ST12'
      - Two-planar NV12-based format used by the video engine found on Allwinner
	(codenamed sunxi) platforms, with 32x32 tiles for the luminance plane
	and 32x64 tiles for the chrominance plane. The data in each tile is
	stored in linear order, within the tile bounds. Each tile follows the
	previous one linearly in memory (from left to right, top to bottom).

	The associated buffer dimensions are aligned to match an integer number
	of tiles, resulting in 32-aligned resolutions for the luminance plane
	and 16-aligned resolutions for the chrominance plane (with 2x2
	subsampling).
