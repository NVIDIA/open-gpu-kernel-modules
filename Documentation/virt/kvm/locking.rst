KVM Lock Overview
=================

1. Acquisition Orders
---------------------

The acquisition orders for mutexes are as follows:

- kvm->lock is taken outside vcpu->mutex

- kvm->lock is taken outside kvm->slots_lock and kvm->irq_lock

- kvm->slots_lock is taken outside kvm->irq_lock, though acquiring
  them together is quite rare.

On x86:

- vcpu->mutex is taken outside kvm->arch.hyperv.hv_lock

- kvm->arch.mmu_lock is an rwlock.  kvm->arch.tdp_mmu_pages_lock is
  taken inside kvm->arch.mmu_lock, and cannot be taken without already
  holding kvm->arch.mmu_lock (typically with ``read_lock``, otherwise
  there's no need to take kvm->arch.tdp_mmu_pages_lock at all).

Everything else is a leaf: no other lock is taken inside the critical
sections.

2. Exception
------------

Fast page fault:

Fast page fault is the fast path which fixes the guest page fault out of
the mmu-lock on x86. Currently, the page fault can be fast in one of the
following two cases:

1. Access Tracking: The SPTE is not present, but it is marked for access
   tracking. That means we need to restore the saved R/X bits. This is
   described in more detail later below.

2. Write-Protection: The SPTE is present and the fault is caused by
   write-protect. That means we just need to change the W bit of the spte.

What we use to avoid all the race is the Host-writable bit and MMU-writable bit
on the spte:

- Host-writable means the gfn is writable in the host kernel page tables and in
  its KVM memslot.
- MMU-writable means the gfn is writable in the guest's mmu and it is not
  write-protected by shadow page write-protection.

On fast page fault path, we will use cmpxchg to atomically set the spte W
bit if spte.HOST_WRITEABLE = 1 and spte.WRITE_PROTECT = 1, to restore the saved
R/X bits if for an access-traced spte, or both. This is safe because whenever
changing these bits can be detected by cmpxchg.

But we need carefully check these cases:

1) The mapping from gfn to pfn

The mapping from gfn to pfn may be changed since we can only ensure the pfn
is not changed during cmpxchg. This is a ABA problem, for example, below case
will happen:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

We dirty-log for gfn1, that means gfn2 is lost in dirty-bitmap.

For direct sp, we can easily avoid it since the spte of direct sp is fixed
to gfn.  For indirect sp, we disabled fast page fault for simplicity.

A solution for indirect sp could be to pin the gfn, for example via
kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_pfn_atomic, before the cmpxchg.  After the pinning:

- We have held the refcount of pfn that means the pfn can not be freed and
  be reused for another gfn.
- The pfn is writable and therefore it cannot be shared between different gfns
  by KSM.

Then, we can ensure the dirty bitmaps is correctly set for a gfn.

2) Dirty bit tracking

In the origin code, the spte can be fast updated (non-atomically) if the
spte is read-only and the Accessed bit has already been set since the
Accessed bit and Dirty bit can not be lost.

But it is not true after fast page fault since the spte can be marked
writable between reading spte and updating spte. Like below case:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| At the beginning::                                                     |

|	spte.W = 0                                                       |
|	spte.Accessed = 1                                                |
+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| CPU 0:                             | CPU 1:                            |

+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The Dirty bit is lost in this case.

In order to avoid this kind of issue, we always treat the spte as "volatile"
if it can be updated out of mmu-lock, see spte_has_volatile_bits(), it means,
the spte is always atomically updated in this case.

3) flush tlbs due to spte updated

If the spte is updated from writable to readonly, we should flush all TLBs,
otherwise rmap_write_protect will find a read-only spte, even though the
writable spte might be cached on a CPU's TLB.

As mentioned before, the spte can be updated to writable out of mmu-lock on
fast page fault path, in order to easily audit the path, we see if TLBs need
be flushed caused by this reason in mmu_spte_update() since this is a common
function to update spte (present -> present).

Since the spte is "volatile" if it can be updated out of mmu-lock, we always
atomically update the spte, the race caused by fast page fault can be avoided,
See the comments in spte_has_volatile_bits() and mmu_spte_update().

Lockless Access Tracking:

This is used for Intel CPUs that are using EPT but do not support the EPT A/D
bits. In this case, PTEs are tagged as A/D disabled (using ignored bits), and
when the KVM MMU notifier is called to track accesses to a page (via
kvm_mmu_notifier_clear_flush_young), it marks the PTE not-present in hardware
by clearing the RWX bits in the PTE and storing the original R & X bits in more
unused/ignored bits. When the VM tries to access the page later on, a fault is
generated and the fast page fault mechanism described above is used to
atomically restore the PTE to a Present state. The W bit is not saved when the
PTE is marked for access tracking and during restoration to the Present state,
the W bit is set depending on whether or not it was a write access. If it
wasn't, then the W bit will remain clear until a write access happens, at which
time it will be set using the Dirty tracking mechanism described above.
