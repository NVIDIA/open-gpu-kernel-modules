What:		/sys/block/rnbd<N>/rnbd/unmap_device
Date:		Feb 2020
KernelVersion:	5.7
Contact:	Jack Wang <jinpu.wang@cloud.ionos.com> Danil Kipnis <danil.kipnis@cloud.ionos.com>
Description:	To unmap a volume, "normal" or "force" has to be written to:
		/sys/block/rnbd<N>/rnbd/unmap_device

		When "normal" is used, the operation will fail with EBUSY if any process
		is using the device.  When "force" is used, the device is also unmapped
		when device is in use.  All I/Os that are in progress will fail.

		Example::

		  # echo "normal" > /sys/block/rnbd0/rnbd/unmap_device

Description:	The file contains the current state of the block device. The state file
		returns "open" when the device is successfully mapped from the server
		and accepting I/O requests. When the connection to the server gets
		disconnected in case of an error (e.g. link failure), the state file
		returns "closed" and all I/O requests submitted to it will fail with -EIO.

		server.  The entry "session" contains the name of the session, that
		was used to establish the RTRS session.  It's the same name that
		was passed as server parameter to the map_device entry.
