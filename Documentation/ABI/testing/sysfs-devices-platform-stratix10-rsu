What:		/sys/devices/platform/stratix10-rsu.0/state
Date:		August 2019
KernelVersion:	5.4
Contact:	Richard Gong <richard.gong@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) the state of RSU system.
		The state field has two parts: major error code in
		upper 16 bits and minor error code in lower 16 bits.

		b[15:0]
			Currently used only when major error is 0xF006
			(CPU watchdog timeout), in which case the minor
			error code is the value reported by CPU to
			firmware through the RSU notify command before
			the watchdog timeout occurs.

		b[31:16]
			0xF001	bitstream error
			0xF002	hardware access failure
			0xF003	bitstream corruption
			0xF004	internal error
			0xF005	device error
			0xF006	CPU watchdog timeout
			0xF007	internal unknown error
