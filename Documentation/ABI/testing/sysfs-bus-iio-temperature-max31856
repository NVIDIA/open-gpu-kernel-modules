Description:
		Open-circuit fault. The detection of open-circuit faults,
		such as those caused by broken thermocouple wires.
		Reading returns either '1' or '0'.

		===  =======================================================
		'1'  An open circuit such as broken thermocouple wires
		     has been detected.
		'0'  No open circuit or broken thermocouple wires are detected
		===  =======================================================

Description:
		Overvoltage or Undervoltage Input Fault. The internal circuitry
		is protected from excessive voltages applied to the thermocouple
		cables by integrated MOSFETs at the T+ and T- inputs, and the
		BIAS output. These MOSFETs turn off when the input voltage is
		negative or greater than VDD.

		Reading returns either '1' or '0'.

		===  =======================================================
		'1'  The input voltage is negative or greater than VDD.
		'0'  The input voltage is positive and less than VDD (normal
		     state).
