		linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Contains the PIM/PAM/POM values, as reported by the
		channel subsystem when last queried by the common I/O
		layer (this implies that this attribute is not necessarily
		in sync with the values current in the channel subsystem).

What:		/sys/bus/css/devices/.../driver_override
Date:		June 2019
Contact:	Cornelia Huck <cohuck@redhat.com>
		linux-s390@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This file allows the driver for a device to be specified. When
		specified, only a driver with a name matching the value written
		to driver_override will have an opportunity to bind to the
		device. The override is specified by writing a string to the
		driver_override file (echo vfio-ccw > driver_override) and
		may be cleared with an empty string (echo > driver_override).
		This returns the device to standard matching rules binding.
		Writing to driver_override does not automatically unbind the
		device from its current driver or make any attempt to
		automatically load the specified driver.  If no driver with a
		matching name is currently loaded in the kernel, the device
		will not bind to any driver.  This also allows devices to
		opt-out of driver binding using a driver_override name such as
		"none".  Only a single driver may be specified in the override,
		there is no support for parsing delimiters.

		Note that unlike the mechanism of the same name for pci, this
		file does not allow to override basic matching rules. I.e.,
		the driver must still match the subchannel type of the device.
