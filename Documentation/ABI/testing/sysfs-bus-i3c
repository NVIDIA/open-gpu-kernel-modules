What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/current_master
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Expose the master that owns the bus (<bus-id>-<master-pid>) at
		the time this file is read. Note that bus ownership can change
		overtime, so there's no guarantee that when the read() call
		returns, the value returned is still valid.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/mode
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		I3C bus mode. Can be "pure", "mixed-fast" or "mixed-slow". See
		the I3C specification for a detailed description of what each
		of these modes implies.

KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The frequency (expressed in Hz) of the SCL signal when
		operating in I3C SDR mode.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/i2c_scl_frequency
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The frequency (expressed in Hz) of the SCL signal when
		operating in I2C mode.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/dynamic_address
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Dynamic address assigned to the master controller. This
		address may change if the bus is re-initialized.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/bcr
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		BCR stands for Bus Characteristics Register and express the
		device capabilities in term of speed, maximum read/write
		length, etc. See the I3C specification for more details.
		This entry describes the BCR of the master controller driving
		the bus.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/dcr
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		DCR stands for Device Characteristics Register and express the
		device capabilities in term of exposed features. See the I3C
		specification for more details.
		This entry describes the DCR of the master controller driving
		the bus.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/pid
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		PID stands for Provisional ID and is used to uniquely identify
		a device on a bus. This PID contains information about the
		vendor, the part and an instance ID so that several devices of
		the same type can be connected on the same bus.
		See the I3C specification for more details.
		This entry describes the PID of the master controller driving
		the bus.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/hdrcap
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Expose the HDR (High Data Rate) capabilities of a device.
		Returns a list of supported HDR mode, each element is separated
		by space. Modes can be "hdr-ddr", "hdr-tsp" and "hdr-tsl".
		See the I3C specification for more details about these HDR
		modes.

		This entry describes the HDRCAP of the master controller
		driving the bus.

What:		/sys/bus/i3c/devices/i3c-<bus-id>/<bus-id>-<device-pid>
KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		An I3C device present on I3C bus identified by <bus-id>. Note
		that all devices are represented including the master driving
		the bus.

KernelVersion:  5.0
Contact:	linux-i3c@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Dynamic address assigned to device <bus-id>-<device-pid>. This
		address may change if the bus is re-initialized.
