What:		/config/stp-policy
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		This group contains policies mandating Master/Channel allocation
		for software sources wishing to send trace data over an STM
		device.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>.<policy>
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		This group is the root of a policy; its name is a concatenation
		of an stm device name to which this policy applies and an
		arbitrary string. If <device> part doesn't match an existing
		stm device, mkdir will fail with ENODEV; if that device already
		has a policy assigned to it, mkdir will fail with EBUSY.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>.<policy>/device
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		STM device to which this policy applies, read only. Same as the
		<device> component of its parent directory.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>.<policy>/<node>
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		Policy node is a string identifier that software clients will
		use to request a master/channel to be allocated and assigned to
		them.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>.<policy>/<node>/masters
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		Range of masters from which to allocate for users of this node.
		Write two numbers: the first master and the last master number.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>.<policy>/<node>/channels
Date:		June 2015
KernelVersion:	4.3
Description:
		Range of channels from which to allocate for users of this node.
		Write two numbers: the first channel and the last channel
		number.
