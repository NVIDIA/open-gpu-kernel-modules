What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/calibration_auto_enable
Date:		June 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Contaminants build-up in the measurement chamber or optical
		elements deterioration leads to sensor drift.

		One can compensate for sensor drift by using automatic self
		calibration procedure (asc).

		Writing 1 or 0 to this attribute will respectively activate or
		deactivate asc.

		Upon reading current asc status is returned.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/calibration_forced_value
Date:		June 2020
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Contaminants build-up in the measurement chamber or optical
		elements deterioration leads to sensor drift.

		One can compensate for sensor drift by using forced
		recalibration (frc). This is useful in case there's known
		co2 reference available nearby the sensor.

		Picking value from the range [400 1 2000] and writing it to the
		sensor will set frc.

		Upon reading current frc value is returned. Note that after
		power cycling default value (i.e 400) is returned even though
		internally sensor had recalibrated itself.
