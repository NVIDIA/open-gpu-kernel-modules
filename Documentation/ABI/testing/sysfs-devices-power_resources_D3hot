Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power_resources_D3hot/ directory is only
		present for device objects representing ACPI device nodes that
		use ACPI power resources for power management and support ACPI
		power state D3hot.

		If present, it contains symbolic links to device directories
		representing ACPI power resources that need to be turned on for
		the given device node to be in ACPI power state D3hot.  The
		names of the links are the same as the names of the directories
		they point to.
