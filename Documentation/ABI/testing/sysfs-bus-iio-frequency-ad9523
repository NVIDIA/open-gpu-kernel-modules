KernelVersion:	3.4.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Reading returns either '1' or '0'.

		'1' means that the clock in question is present.

		'0' means that the clock is missing.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/pllY_locked
KernelVersion:	3.4.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Reading returns either '1' or '0'. '1' means that the
		pllY is locked.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/sync_dividers
KernelVersion:	3.4.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Writing '1' triggers the clock distribution synchronization
		functionality. All dividers are reset and the channels start
		with their predefined phase offsets (out_altvoltageY_phase).
		Writing this file has the effect as driving the external
		/SYNC pin low.
