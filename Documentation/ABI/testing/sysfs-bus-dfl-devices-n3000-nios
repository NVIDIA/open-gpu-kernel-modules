KernelVersion:	5.12
Contact:	Xu Yilun <yilun.xu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. Returns the FEC mode of the 25G links of the
		ethernet retimers configured by Nios firmware. "rs" for Reed
		Solomon FEC, "kr" for Fire Code FEC, "no" for NO FEC.
		"not supported" if the FEC mode setting is not supported, this
		happens when the Nios firmware version major < 3, or no link is
		configured to 25G.
		Format: string

Date:		Oct 2020
KernelVersion:	5.12
Contact:	Xu Yilun <yilun.xu@intel.com>
Description:	Read-only. Returns the enumeration value of the working mode of
		the retimer A configured by the Nios firmware. The value is
		read out from shared registers filled by the Nios firmware. Now
		the values could be:

		- "0": Reset
		- "1": 4x10G
		- "2": 4x25G
		- "3": 2x25G
		- "4": 2x25G+2x10G
		- "5": 1x25G

		If the Nios firmware is updated in future to support more
		retimer modes, more enumeration value is expected.
		Format: 0x%x

Description:	Read-only. Returns the enumeration value of the working mode of
		the retimer B configured by the Nios firmware. The value format
		is the same as retimer_A_mode.
