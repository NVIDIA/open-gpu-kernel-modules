What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/flash_brightness
Date:		March 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Jacek Anaszewski <j.anaszewski@samsung.com>
Description:	read/write
		Set the brightness of this LED in the flash strobe mode, in
		microamperes. The file is created only for the flash LED devices
		that support setting flash brightness.

		The value is between 0 and
		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_flash_brightness.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_flash_brightness
Date:		March 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Jacek Anaszewski <j.anaszewski@samsung.com>
Description:	read only
		Maximum brightness level for this LED in the flash strobe mode,
		in microamperes.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/flash_timeout
Date:		March 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Jacek Anaszewski <j.anaszewski@samsung.com>
Description:	read/write
		Hardware timeout for flash, in microseconds. The flash strobe
		is stopped after this period of time has passed from the start
		of the strobe. The file is created only for the flash LED
		devices that support setting flash timeout.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_flash_timeout
Date:		March 2015

Description:	read only
		Maximum flash timeout for this LED, in microseconds.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/flash_strobe
Date:		March 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Jacek Anaszewski <j.anaszewski@samsung.com>
Description:	read/write
		Flash strobe state. When written with 1 it triggers flash strobe
		and when written with 0 it turns the flash off.

		On read 1 means that flash is currently strobing and 0 means
		that flash is off.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/flash_fault
Date:		March 2015
KernelVersion:	4.0
Contact:	Jacek Anaszewski <j.anaszewski@samsung.com>
Description:	read only
		Space separated list of flash faults that may have occurred.
		Flash faults are re-read after strobing the flash. Possible
		flash faults:

		* led-over-voltage
			flash controller voltage to the flash LED
			has exceeded the limit specific to the flash controller
		* flash-timeout-exceeded
			the flash strobe was still on when
			the timeout set by the user has expired; not all flash
			controllers may set this in all such conditions
		* controller-over-temperature
			the flash controller has
			overheated
		* controller-short-circuit
			the short circuit protection
			of the flash controller has been triggered
		* led-power-supply-over-current
			current in the LED power
			supply has exceeded the limit specific to the flash
			controller
		* indicator-led-fault
			the flash controller has detected
			a short or open circuit condition on the indicator LED
		* led-under-voltage
			flash controller voltage to the flash
			LED has been below the minimum limit specific to
			the flash
		* controller-under-voltage
			the input voltage of the flash
			controller is below the limit under which strobing the
			flash at full current will not be possible;
			the condition persists until this flag is no longer set
		* led-over-temperature
			the temperature of the LED has exceeded
			its allowed upper limit
