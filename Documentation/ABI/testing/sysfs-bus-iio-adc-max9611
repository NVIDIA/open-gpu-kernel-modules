Description: 	The value of the shunt resistor used to compute current flowing
                between RS+ and RS- voltage sense inputs. In Ohms.

These attributes describe a single physical component, exposed as two distinct
attributes as it is used to calculate two different values: power load and
current flowing between RS+ and RS- inputs.
