Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../power_resources_wakeup/ directory is only
		present for device objects representing ACPI device nodes that
		require ACPI power resources for wakeup signaling.

		If present, it contains symbolic links to device directories
		representing ACPI power resources that need to be turned on for
		the given device node to be able to signal wakeup.  The names of
		the links are the same as the names of the directories they
		point to.
