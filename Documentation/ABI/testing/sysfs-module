Description:	Maximum time allowed for periodic transfers per microframe (Î¼s)

		Note:
		  USB 2.0 sets maximum allowed time for periodic transfers per
		  microframe to be 80%, that is 100 microseconds out of 125
		  microseconds (full microframe).

		  However there are cases, when 80% max isochronous bandwidth is
		  too limiting. For example two video streams could require 110
		  microseconds of isochronous bandwidth per microframe to work
		  together.

		Through this setting it is possible to raise the limit so that
		the host controller would allow allocating more than 100
		microseconds of periodic bandwidth per microframe.

		Beware, non-standard modes are usually not thoroughly tested by
		hardware designers, and the hardware can malfunction when this
		setting differ from default 100.
