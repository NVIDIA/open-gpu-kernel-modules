Description:
		A read-only description of Dell platform tokens
		available on the machine.

		Each token attribute is available as a pair of
		sysfs attributes readable by a process with
		CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

		For example the token ID "5" would be available
		as the following attributes:

		- 0005_location
		- 0005_value

		Tokens will vary from machine to machine, and
		only tokens available on that machine will be
		displayed.
