What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/reset_counters
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This write-only control file will zero all the statistical
		counters for UE and CE errors on the given memory controller.
		Zeroing the counters will also reset the timer indicating how
		long since the last counter were reset. This is useful for
		computing errors/time.  Since the counters are always reset
		at driver initialization time, no module/kernel parameter
		is available.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/seconds_since_reset
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays how many seconds have elapsed
		since the last counter reset. This can be used with the error
		counters to measure error rates.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/mc_name
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the type of memory controller
		that is being utilized.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/size_mb
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays, in count of megabytes, of memory

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ue_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the total count of uncorrectable
		errors that have occurred on this memory controller. If
		panic_on_ue is set, this counter will not have a chance to
		increment, since EDAC will panic the system

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ue_noinfo_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the number of UEs that have
		occurred on this memory controller with no information as to
		which DIMM slot is having errors.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ce_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the total count of correctable
		errors that have occurred on this memory controller. This
		count is very important to examine. CEs provide early
		indications that a DIMM is beginning to fail. This count
		field should be monitored for non-zero values and report
		such information to the system administrator.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/ce_noinfo_count
Date:		January 2006
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the number of CEs that
		have occurred on this memory controller wherewith no
		information as to which DIMM slot is having errors. Memory is
		handicapped, but operational, yet no information is available
		to indicate which slot the failing memory is in. This count
		field should be also be monitored for non-zero values.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/sdram_scrub_rate
Date:		February 2007
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Read/Write attribute file that controls memory scrubbing.
		The scrubbing rate used by the memory controller is set by
		writing a minimum bandwidth in bytes/sec to the attribute file.
		The rate will be translated to an internal value that gives at
		least the specified rate.
		Reading the file will return the actual scrubbing rate employed.
		If configuration fails or memory scrubbing is not implemented,
		the value of the attribute file will be -1.

Date:		April 2012
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
		linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file displays the information about the last
		available memory slot in this memory controller. It is used by
		userspace tools in order to display the memory filling layout.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/(dimm|rank)*/size
Date:		April 2012
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
		linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file will display the size of dimm or rank.
		For dimm*/size, this is the size, in MB of the DIMM memory
		stick. For rank*/size, this is the size, in MB for one rank
		of the DIMM memory stick. On single rank memories (1R), this
		is also the total size of the dimm. On dual rank (2R) memories,
		this is half the size of the total DIMM memories.

Description:	This attribute file will display what type of DRAM device is
		being utilized on this DIMM (x1, x2, x4, x8, ...).

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/(dimm|rank)*/dimm_edac_mode

Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
		linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This attribute file will display what type of Error detection
		and correction is being utilized. For example: S4ECD4ED would
		mean a Chipkill with x4 DRAM.

What:		/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc*/(dimm|rank)*/dimm_label
Date:		April 2012
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
		linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:	This control file allows this DIMM to have a label assigned
		to it. With this label in the module, when errors occur
		the output can provide the DIMM label in the system log.
		This becomes vital for panic events to isolate the
		cause of the UE event.
		DIMM Labels must be assigned after booting, with information
		that correctly identifies the physical slot with its
		silk screen label. This information is currently very
		motherboard specific and determination of this information
		must occur in userland at this time.
