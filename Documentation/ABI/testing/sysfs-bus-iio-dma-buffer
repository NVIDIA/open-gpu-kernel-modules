Description:
		DMA buffers tend to have a alignment requirement for the
		buffers. If this alignment requirement is not met samples might
		be dropped from the buffer.

		This property reports the alignment requirements in bytes.
		This means that the buffer size in bytes needs to be a integer
		multiple of the number reported by this file.

		The alignment requirements in number of sample sets will depend
		on the enabled channels and the bytes per channel. This means
		that the alignment requirement in samples sets might change
		depending on which and how many channels are enabled. Whereas
		the alignment requirement reported in bytes by this property
		will remain static and does not depend on which channels are
		enabled.
