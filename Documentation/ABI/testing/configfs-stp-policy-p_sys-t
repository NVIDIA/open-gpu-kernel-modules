What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>:p_sys-t.<policy>/<node>/uuid
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:	4.19
Description:
		UUID source identifier string, RW.
		Default value is randomly generated at the mkdir <node> time.
		Data coming from trace sources that use this <node> will be
		tagged with this UUID in the MIPI SyS-T packet stream, to
		allow the decoder to discern between different sources
		within the same master/channel range, and identify the
		higher level decoders that may be needed for each source.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>:p_sys-t.<policy>/<node>/do_len
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:	4.19
Description:
		Include payload length in the MIPI SyS-T header, boolean.
		If enabled, the SyS-T protocol encoder will include payload
		length in each packet's metadata. This is normally redundant
		if the underlying transport protocol supports marking message
		boundaries (which STP does), so this is off by default.

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>:p_sys-t.<policy>/<node>/ts_interval
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:	4.19
Description:
		Time interval in milliseconds. Include a timestamp in the
		MIPI SyS-T packet metadata, if this many milliseconds have
		passed since the previous packet from this source. Zero is
		the default and stands for "never send the timestamp".

What:		/config/stp-policy/<device>:p_sys-t.<policy>/<node>/clocksync_interval
Date:		June 2018
KernelVersion:	4.19
Description:
		Time interval in milliseconds. Send a CLOCKSYNC packet if
		this many milliseconds have passed since the previous
		CLOCKSYNC packet from this source. Zero is the default and
		stands for "never send the CLOCKSYNC". It makes sense to
		use this option with sources that generate constant and/or
		periodic data, like stm_heartbeat.
