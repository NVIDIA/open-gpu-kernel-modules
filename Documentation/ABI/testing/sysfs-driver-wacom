Description:
		The /sys/bus/hid/devices/<bus>:<vid>:<pid>.<n>/speed file
		controls reporting speed of Wacom bluetooth tablet. Reading
		from this file returns 1 if tablet reports in high speed mode
		or 0 otherwise. Writing to this file one of these values
		switches reporting speed.

Description:
		Attribute group for control of the status LEDs and the OLEDs.
		This attribute group is only available for Intuos 4 M, L,
		and XL (with LEDs and OLEDs), Intuos 4 WL, Intuos 5 (LEDs only),
		Intuos Pro (LEDs only) and Cintiq 21UX2 and Cintiq 24HD
		(LEDs only). Therefore its presence implicitly signifies the
		presence of said LEDs and OLEDs on the tablet device.

Description:
		<obsoleted by the LED class API now exported by the driver>
		Writing to this file sets the status LED luminance (1..127)
		when the stylus does not touch the tablet surface, and no
		button is pressed on the stylus. This luminance level is
		normally lower than the level when a button is pressed.

		Writing to this file sets which one of the four (for Intuos 4
		and Intuos 5) or of the right four (for Cintiq 21UX2 and Cintiq
		24HD) status LEDs is active (0..3). The other three LEDs on the
		same side are always inactive.

Description:
		When writing a 1024 byte raw image in Wacom Intuos 4
		interleaving format to the file, the image shows up on Button N
		of the device. The image is a 64x32 pixel 4-bit gray image. The
		1024 byte binary is split up into 16x 64 byte chunks. Each 64
		byte chunk encodes the image data for two consecutive lines on
		the display. The low nibble of each byte contains the first
		line, and the high nibble contains the second line.
		When the Wacom Intuos 4 is connected over Bluetooth, the
		image has to contain 256 bytes (64x32 px 1 bit colour).
		The format is also scrambled, like in the USB mode, and it can
		be summarized by converting::

					    76543210 into GECA6420.

Description:
		<obsoleted by the LED class API now exported by the driver>
		Reading from this file reports the mode status of the
		remote as indicated by the LED lights on the device. If no
		reports have been received from the paired device, reading
		from this file will report '-1'. The mode is read-only
		and cannot be set through the driver.
