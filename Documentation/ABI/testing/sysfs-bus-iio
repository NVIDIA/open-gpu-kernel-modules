KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		An event driven driver of data capture to an in kernel buffer.
		May be provided by a device driver that also has an IIO device
		based on hardware generated events (e.g. data ready) or
		provided by a separate driver for other hardware (e.g.
		periodic timer, GPIO or high resolution timer).

		Contains trigger type specific elements. These do not
		generalize well and hence are not documented in this file.
		X is the IIO index of the trigger.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/label
KernelVersion:	5.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Optional symbolic label for a device.
		This is useful for userspace to be able to better identify an
		individual device.

		The contents of the label are free-form, but there are some
		standardized uses:

		For proximity sensors which give the proximity (of a person) to
		a certain wlan or wwan antenna the following standardized labels
		are used:

		* "proximity-wifi"
		* "proximity-lte"
		* "proximity-wifi-lte"
		* "proximity-wifi-left"
		* "proximity-wifi-right"

		These are used to indicate to userspace that these proximity
		sensors may be used to tune transmit power to ensure that
		Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limits are honored.
		The "-left" and "-right" labels are for devices with multiple
		antennas.

		In some laptops/tablets the standardized proximity sensor labels
		instead	indicate proximity to a specific part of the device:

		* "proximity-palmrest" indicates proximity to the keyboard's palmrest
		* "proximity-palmrest-left" indicates proximity to the left part of the palmrest
		* "proximity-palmrest-right" indicates proximity to the right part of the palmrest
		* "proximity-lap" indicates the device is being used on someone's lap

		Note "proximity-lap" is special in that its value may be
		calculated by firmware from other sensor readings, rather then
		being a raw sensor reading.

		For accelerometers used in 2-in-1s with 360Â° (yoga-style) hinges,
		which have an accelerometer in both their base and their display,
		the following standardized labels are used:

		* "accel-base"
		* "accel-display"

KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Some devices have internal clocks.  This parameter sets the
		resulting sampling frequency.  In many devices this
		parameter has an effect on input filters etc. rather than
		simply controlling when the input is sampled.  As this
		affects data ready triggers, hardware buffers and the sysfs
		direct access interfaces, it may be found in any of the
		relevant directories.  If it affects all of the above
		then it is to be found in the base device directory.

KernelVersion:	5.13
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Descrption:
		Adaptive thresholds are similar to normal fixed thresholds
		but the value is expressed as an offset from a value which
		provides a low frequency approximation of the channel itself.
		Thus these detect if a rapid change occurs in the specified
		direction which crosses tracking value + offset.
		Tracking value calculation is devices specific.

KernelVersion:	5.11
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Descrption:
		When adaptive thresholds are used, the tracking signal
		may adjust too slowly to step changes in the raw signal.
		*_timeout (in seconds) specifies a time for which the
		difference between the slow tracking signal and the raw
		signal is allowed to remain out-of-range before a reset
		event occurs in which the tracking signal is made equal
		to the raw signal, allowing slow tracking to resume and the
		adaptive threshold event detection to function as expected.

Description:
		Specifies the hysteresis of threshold that the device is comparing
		against for the events enabled by
		<type>Y[_name]_thresh[_(rising|falling)]_hysteresis.
		If separate attributes exist for the two directions, but
		direction is not specified for this attribute, then a single
		hysteresis value applies to both directions.

		For falling events the hysteresis is added to the _value attribute for
		this event to get the upper threshold for when the event goes back to
		normal, for rising events the hysteresis is subtracted from the _value
		attribute. E.g. if in_voltage0_raw_thresh_rising_value is set to 1200
		and in_voltage0_raw_thresh_rising_hysteresis is set to 50. The event
		will get activated once in_voltage0_raw goes above 1200 and will become
		deactivated again once the value falls below 1150.

Description:
		Description of the scan element data storage within the buffer
		and hence the form in which it is read from user-space.
		Form is [be|le]:[s|u]bits/storagebits[>>shift].
		be or le specifies big or little endian. s or u specifies if
		signed (2's complement) or unsigned. bits is the number of bits
		of data and storagebits is the space (after padding) that it
		occupies in the buffer. shift if specified, is the shift that
		needs to be applied prior to masking out unused bits. Some
		devices put their data in the middle of the transferred elements
		with additional information on both sides.  Note that some
		devices will have additional information in the unused bits
		so to get a clean value, the bits value must be used to mask
		the buffer output value appropriately.  The storagebits value
		also specifies the data alignment.  So s48/64>>2 will be a
		signed 48 bit integer stored in a 64 bit location aligned to
		a 64 bit boundary. To obtain the clean value, shift right 2
		and apply a mask to zero the top 16 bits of the result.
		For other storage combinations this attribute will be extended
		appropriately.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/buffer/hwfifo_enabled

Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read-only boolean value that indicates if the hardware fifo is
		currently enabled or disabled. If the device does not have a

		The hardware fifo is enabled when the buffer is enabled if the
		current hardware fifo watermark level is set and other current
		device settings allows it (e.g. if a trigger is set that samples
		data differently that the hardware fifo does then hardware fifo
		will not enabled).

		If the hardware fifo is enabled and the level of the hardware
		fifo reaches the hardware fifo watermark level the device will
		flush its hardware fifo to the device buffer. Doing a non
		blocking read on the device when no samples are present in the
		device buffer will also force a flush.

		When the hardware fifo is enabled there is no need to use a
		trigger to use buffer mode since the watermark settings
		guarantees that the hardware fifo is flushed to the device
		buffer.

Description:
		Mounting matrix for IIO sensors. This is a rotation matrix which
		informs userspace about sensor chip's placement relative to the
		main hardware it is mounted on.

		Main hardware placement is defined according to the local
		reference frame related to the physical quantity the sensor
		measures.

		Given that the rotation matrix is defined in a board specific
		way (platform data and / or device-tree), the main hardware
		reference frame definition is left to the implementor's choice
		(see below for a magnetometer example).

		Applications should apply this rotation matrix to samples so
		that when main hardware reference frame is aligned onto local
		reference frame, then sensor chip reference frame is also
		perfectly aligned with it.

		Matrix is a 3x3 unitary matrix and typically looks like
		[0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]. Identity matrix
		[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1] means sensor chip and main hardware
		are perfectly aligned with each other.

		For example, a mounting matrix for a magnetometer sensor informs
		userspace about sensor chip's ORIENTATION relative to the main
		hardware.

		More specifically, main hardware orientation is defined with
		respect to the LOCAL EARTH GEOMAGNETIC REFERENCE FRAME where :

		* Y is in the ground plane and positive towards magnetic North ;
		* X is in the ground plane, perpendicular to the North axis and
		  positive towards the East ;
		* Z is perpendicular to the ground plane and positive upwards.

		An implementor might consider that for a hand-held device, a
		'natural' orientation would be 'front facing camera at the top'.
		The main hardware reference frame could then be described as :

		* Y is in the plane of the screen and is positive towards the
		  top of the screen ;
		* X is in the plane of the screen, perpendicular to Y axis, and
		  positive towards the right hand side of the screen ;
		* Z is perpendicular to the screen plane and positive out of the
		  screen.

		Another example for a quadrotor UAV might be :

		* Y is in the plane of the propellers and positive towards the
		  front-view camera;
		* X is in the plane of the propellers, perpendicular to Y axis,
		  and positive towards the starboard side of the UAV ;
		* Z is perpendicular to propellers plane and positive upwards.
