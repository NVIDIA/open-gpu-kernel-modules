What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/triggerX/trigger_now
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This file is provided by the iio-trig-sysfs stand-alone trigger
		driver. Writing this file with any value triggers an event
		driven driver, associated with this trigger, to capture data
		into an in kernel buffer. This approach can be valuable during
		automated testing or in situations, where other trigger methods
		are not applicable. For example no RTC or spare GPIOs.
		X is the IIO index of the trigger.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/triggerX/name
KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The name attribute holds a description string for the current
		trigger. In order to associate the trigger with an IIO device
		one should write this name string to
		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceY/trigger/current_trigger.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio_sysfs_trigger/add_trigger
KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is provided by the iio-trig-sysfs stand-alone
		driver and it is used to activate the creation of a new trigger.
		In order to achieve this, one should write a positive integer
		into the associated file, which will serve as the id of the
		trigger. If the trigger with the specified id is already present
		in the system, an invalid argument message will be returned.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio_sysfs_trigger/remove_trigger
KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is used to unregister and delete a previously
		created trigger from the list of available triggers. In order to
		achieve this, one should write a positive integer into the
		associated file, representing the id of the trigger that needs
		to be removed. If the trigger can't be found, an invalid
		argument message will be returned to the user.
