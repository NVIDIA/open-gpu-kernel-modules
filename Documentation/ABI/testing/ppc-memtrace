KernelVersion:	4.14
Contact:	linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:	This folder contains the relevant debugfs files for the
		hardware trace macro to use. CONFIG_PPC64_HARDWARE_TRACING
		must be set.

Contact:	linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:	Write an integer containing the size in bytes of the memory
		you want removed from each NUMA node to this file - it must be
		aligned to the memblock size. This amount of RAM will be removed
		from each NUMA node in the kernel mappings and the following
		debugfs files will be created. Once memory is successfully
		removed from each node, the following files are created. To
		re-add memory to the kernel, echo 0 into this file (it will be
		automatically onlined).
