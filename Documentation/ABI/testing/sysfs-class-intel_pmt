KernelVersion:	5.10
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The telem<x> directory contains files describing an instance of
		a PMT telemetry device that exposes hardware telemetry. Each
		telem<x> directory has an associated telem file. This file
		may be opened and mapped or read to access the telemetry space
		of the device. The register layout of the telemetry space is
		determined from an XML file that matches the PCI device id and
		GUID for the device.

Date:		October 2020
KernelVersion:	5.10
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The telemetry data for this telemetry device. This file
		may be mapped or read to obtain the data.

Date:		October 2020
KernelVersion:	5.10
Contact:	David Box <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RO) The GUID for this telemetry device. The GUID identifies
		the version of the XML file for the parent device that is to
		be used to get the register layout.

Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The crashlog<x> directory contains files for configuring an
		instance of a PMT crashlog device that can perform crash data
		recording. Each crashlog<x> device has an associated crashlog
		file. This file can be opened and mapped or read to access the
		resulting crashlog buffer. The register layout for the buffer
		can be determined from an XML file of specified GUID for the
		parent device.

Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) Boolean value controlling if the crashlog functionality
		is enabled for the crashlog device.

What:		/sys/class/intel_pmt/crashlog<x>/trigger
Date:		October 2020
KernelVersion:	5.10
Contact:	Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(RW) Boolean value controlling the triggering of the crashlog
		device node. When read it provides data on if the crashlog has
		been triggered. When written to it can be used to either clear
		the current trigger by writing false, or to trigger a new
		event if the trigger is not currently set.
