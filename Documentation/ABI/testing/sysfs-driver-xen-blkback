Description:
                Maximum number of grants to map persistently in
                blkback. If the frontend tries to use more than
                max_persistent_grants, the LRU kicks in and starts
                removing 5% of max_persistent_grants every 100ms.

Description:
                How long a persistent grant is allowed to remain
                allocated without being in use. The time is in
                seconds, 0 means indefinitely long.
                The default is 60 seconds.

Description:
                When memory pressure is reported to blkback this option
                controls the duration in milliseconds that blkback will not
                cache any page not backed by a grant mapping.
                The default is 10ms.
