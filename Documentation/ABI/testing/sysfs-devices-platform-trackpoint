Date:		Aug, 2005
KernelVersion:	2.6.14
Contact:	linux-input@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) Writing a value of 1 to this file will enable the Press to
		Select functions like tapping the control stick to simulate a
		left click, and writing 0 will disable it.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/i8042/.../drift_time
Date:		Dec, 2014
KernelVersion:	3.19
Contact:	linux-input@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) This parameter controls the period of time to test for a
		‘hands off’ condition (i.e. when no force is applied) before a
		drift (noise) calibration occurs.

		IBM Trackpoints have a feature to compensate for drift by
		recalibrating themselves periodically. By default, if for 0.5
		seconds there is no change in position, it's used as the new
		zero. This duration is too low. Often, the calibration happens
		when the trackpoint is in fact being used.
