Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe the magic bits
                that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

                Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
                perf_event_attr.config. All supported attributes are listed
                below::

				counter_info_version  = "config:16-23"
				length  = "config:24-31"
				partition_id  = "config:32-63"
				request = "config:0-31"
				sibling_part_id = "config:32-63"
				hw_chip_id = "config:32-63"
				offset = "config:32-63"
				phys_processor_idx = "config:32-63"
				secondary_index = "config:0-15"
				starting_index = "config:32-63"

                For example::

		  processor_core_utilization_instructions_completed = "request=0x94,
					phys_processor_idx=?,counter_info_version=0x8,
					length=8,offset=0x18"

		In this event, '?' after phys_processor_idx specifies this value
		this value will be provided by user while running this event.
