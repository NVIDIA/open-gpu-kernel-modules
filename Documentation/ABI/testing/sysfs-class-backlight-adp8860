sysfs interface for analog devices adp8860 backlight driver
-----------------------------------------------------------

The backlight brightness control operates at three different levels for the
adp8860, adp8861 and adp8863 devices: daylight (level 1), office (level 2) and
dark (level 3). By default the brightness operates at the daylight brightness
level.

/sys/class/backlight/<backlight>/ambient_light_zone.

Description:
		(RW) Maximum current setting for the backlight when brightness
		is at one of the three levels (daylight, office or dark). This
		is an input code between 0 and 127, which is transformed to a
		value between 0 mA and 30 mA using linear or non-linear
		algorithms.
