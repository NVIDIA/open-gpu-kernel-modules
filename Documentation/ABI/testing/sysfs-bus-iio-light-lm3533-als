Description:
		Event generated when channel passes one of the four thresholds
		in each direction (rising|falling) and a zone change occurs.
		The corresponding light zone can be read from
		in_illuminance0_zone.

Description:
		Get the hysteresis for thresholds Y, that is,
		threshY_hysteresis = threshY_raising - threshY_falling

Date:		April 2012
KernelVersion:	3.5
Contact:	Johan Hovold <jhovold@gmail.com>
Description:
		Specifies the value of threshold that the device is comparing
		against for the events enabled by
		in_illuminance0_thresh_either_en (0..255), where Y in 0..3.

		Note that threshY_falling must be less than or equal to
		threshY_raising.

		These thresholds correspond to the eight zone-boundary
		registers (boundaryY_{low,high}) and define the five light
		zones.

Description:
		Get output current for channel Y (0..255), that is,
		out_currentY_currentZ_raw, where Z is the current zone.

Description:
		Set the output current for channel out_currentY when in zone
		Z (0..255), where Y in 0..2 and Z in 0..4.

		These values correspond to the ALS-mapper target registers for
		ALS-mapper Y + 1.
