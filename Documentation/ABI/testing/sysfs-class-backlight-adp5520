sysfs interface for analog devices adp5520(01) backlight driver
---------------------------------------------------------------

The backlight brightness control operates at three different levels for the
adp5520 and adp5501 devices: daylight (level 1), office (level 2) and dark
(level 3). By default the brightness operates at the daylight brightness level.

Description:
		(RW) Maximum current setting for the backlight when brightness
		is at one of the three levels (daylight, office or dark). This
		is an input code between 0 and 127, which is transformed to a
		value between 0 mA and 30 mA using linear or non-linear
		algorithms.
