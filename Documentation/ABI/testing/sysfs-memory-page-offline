What:		/sys/devices/system/memory/soft_offline_page
Date:		Sep 2009
KernelVersion:	2.6.33
Contact:	andi@firstfloor.org
Description:
		Soft-offline the memory page containing the physical address
		written into this file. Input is a hex number specifying the
		physical address of the page. The kernel will then attempt
		to soft-offline it, by moving the contents elsewhere or
		dropping it if possible. The kernel will then be placed
		on the bad page list and never be reused.

		The offlining is done in kernel specific granuality.
		Normally it's the base page size of the kernel, but
		this might change.

		The page must be still accessible, not poisoned. The
		kernel will never kill anything for this, but rather
		fail the offline.  Return value is the size of the
		number, or a error when the offlining failed.  Reading
		the file is not allowed.

Description:
		Hard-offline the memory page containing the physical
		address written into this file. Input is a hex number
		specifying the physical address of the page. The
		kernel will then attempt to hard-offline the page, by
		trying to drop the page or killing any owner or
		triggering IO errors if needed.  Note this may kill
		any processes owning the page. The kernel will avoid
		to access this page assuming it's poisoned by the
		hardware.

		The offlining is done in kernel specific granuality.
		Normally it's the base page size of the kernel, but
		this might change.

		Return value is the size of the number, or a error when
		the offlining failed.
