What:		/sys/class/typec/<port>/data_role
Date:		April 2017
Contact:	Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		The supported USB data roles. This attribute can be used for
		requesting data role swapping on the port. Swapping is supported
		as synchronous operation, so write(2) to the attribute will not
		return until the operation has finished. The attribute is
		notified about role changes so that poll(2) on the attribute
		wakes up. Change on the role will also generate uevent
		KOBJ_CHANGE on the port. The current role is show in brackets,
		for example "[host] device" when DRP port is in host mode.

		Valid values: host, device

		power role swap on the port. Swapping is supported as
		synchronous operation, so write(2) to the attribute will not
		return until the operation has finished. The attribute is
		notified about role changes so that poll(2) on the attribute
		wakes up. Change on the role will also generate uevent
		KOBJ_CHANGE. The current role is show in brackets, for example
		"[source] sink" when in source mode.

		Valid values: source, sink

What:           /sys/class/typec/<port>/port_type
Date:           May 2017
Contact:	Badhri Jagan Sridharan <Badhri@google.com>
Description:
		Indicates the type of the port. This attribute can be used for
		requesting a change in the port type. Port type change is
		supported as a synchronous operation, so write(2) to the
		attribute will not return until the operation has finished.

		Valid values:

		======  ==============================================
		source  (The port will behave as source only DFP port)
		sink    (The port will behave as sink only UFP port)

		when both the port and the partner support USB Power Delivery.
		Swapping is supported as synchronous operation, so write(2) to
		the attribute will not return until the operation has finished.
		The attribute is notified about VCONN source changes so that
		poll(2) on the attribute wakes up. Change on VCONN source also
		generates uevent KOBJ_CHANGE.

		Valid values:

		- "no" when the port is not the VCONN Source
		- "yes" when the port is the VCONN Source
