Description:
		Can be set and read.
		Set a_bus_req(A-device bus request) input to be 1 if
		the application running on the A-device wants to use the bus,
		and to be 0 when the application no longer wants to use
		the bus(or wants to work as peripheral). a_bus_req can also
		be set to 1 by kernel in response to remote wakeup signaling
		from the B-device, the A-device should decide to resume the bus.

		Valid values are "1" and "0".

		Reading: returns 1 if the application running on the A-device
		is using the bus as host role, otherwise 0.

Description:
		Can be set and read
		The a_bus_drop(A-device bus drop) input is 1 when the

		the bus, and is 0 otherwise, When a_bus_drop is 1, then
		the a_bus_req shall be 0.

		Valid values are "1" and "0".

Description:
		Can be set and read.
		The b_bus_req(B-device bus request) input is 1 during the time
