Description:
		This file allows the driver for a device to be specified which
		will override standard OF, ACPI, ID table, and name matching.
		When specified, only a driver with a name matching the value
		written to driver_override will have an opportunity to bind to
		the device. The override is specified by writing a string to the
		driver_override file (echo vfio-amba > driver_override)	and may
		be cleared with an empty string (echo > driver_override).
		This returns the device to standard matching rules binding.
		Writing to driver_override does not automatically unbind the
		device from its current driver or make any attempt to
		automatically load the specified driver. If no driver with a
		matching name is currently loaded in the kernel, the device will
		not bind to any driver. This also allows devices to opt-out of
		driver binding using a driver_override name such as "none".
		Only a single driver may be specified in the override, there is
		no support for parsing delimiters.
