Description:	Kernel Samepage Merging daemon sysfs interface

		full_scans: how many times all mergeable areas have been
		scanned.

		pages_shared: how many shared pages are being used.

		pages_sharing: how many more sites are sharing them i.e. how
		much saved.

		pages_to_scan: how many present pages to scan before ksmd goes
		to sleep.

		pages_unshared: how many pages unique but repeatedly checked
		for merging.

		pages_volatile: how many pages changing too fast to be placed
		in a tree.

		run: write 0 to disable ksm, read 0 while ksm is disabled.

			- write 1 to run ksm, read 1 while ksm is running.
			- write 2 to disable ksm and unmerge all its pages.

		sleep_millisecs: how many milliseconds ksm should sleep between
		scans.

		See Documentation/vm/ksm.rst for more information.

Description:	Control merging pages across different NUMA nodes.

		When it is set to 0 only pages from the same node are merged,
		otherwise pages from all nodes can be merged together (default).
