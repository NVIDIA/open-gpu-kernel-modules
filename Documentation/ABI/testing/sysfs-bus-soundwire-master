Description:	SoundWire Master-N DisCo properties.
		These properties are defined by MIPI DisCo Specification
		for SoundWire. They define various properties of the Master
		and are used by the bus to configure the Master. clk_stop_modes
		is a bitmask for simplifications and combines the
		clock-stop-mode0 and clock-stop-mode1 properties.
