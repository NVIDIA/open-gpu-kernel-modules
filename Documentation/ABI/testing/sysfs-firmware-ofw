Description:
		When using OpenFirmware or a Flattened Device Tree to enumerate
		hardware, the device tree structure will be exposed in this
		directory.

		It is possible for multiple device-tree directories to exist.
		Some device drivers use a separate detached device tree which
		have no attachment to the system tree and will appear in a
		different subdirectory under /sys/firmware/devicetree.

		Userspace must not use the /sys/firmware/devicetree/base
		path directly, but instead should follow /proc/device-tree
		symlink. It is possible that the absolute path will change
		in the future, but the symlink is the stable ABI.

		The /proc/device-tree symlink replaces the devicetree /proc
		filesystem support, and has largely the same semantics and
		should be compatible with existing userspace.

		The contents of /sys/firmware/devicetree/ is a
		hierarchy of directories, one per device tree node. The
		directory name is the resolved path component name (node
		name plus address). Properties are represented as files
		in the directory. The contents of each file is the exact
		binary data from the device tree.

Description:
		Exports the FDT blob that was passed to the kernel by
		the bootloader. This allows userland applications such
		as kexec to access the raw binary. This blob is also
		useful when debugging since it contains any changes
		made to the blob by the bootloader.

		The fact that this node does not reside under
		/sys/firmware/device-tree is deliberate: FDT is also used
		on arm64 UEFI/ACPI systems to communicate just the UEFI
		and ACPI entry points, but the FDT is never unflattened
		and used to configure the system.

		A CRC32 checksum is calculated over the entire FDT
		blob, and verified at late_initcall time. The sysfs
		entry is instantiated only if the checksum is valid,
		i.e., if the FDT blob has not been modified in the mean
		time. Otherwise, a warning is printed.
Users:		kexec, debugging
