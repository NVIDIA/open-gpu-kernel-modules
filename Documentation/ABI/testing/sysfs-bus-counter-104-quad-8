What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY/cable_fault
KernelVersion:	5.7
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Read-only attribute that indicates whether a differential
		encoder cable fault (not connected or loose wires) is detected
		for the respective channel of Signal Y. Valid attribute values
		are boolean. Detection must first be enabled via the
		corresponding cable_fault_enable attribute.

Description:
		Whether detection of differential encoder cable faults for the
		respective channel of Signal Y is enabled. Valid attribute
		values are boolean.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY/filter_clock_prescaler
KernelVersion:	5.7
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Filter clock factor for input Signal Y. This prescaler value
		affects the inputs of both quadrature pair signals.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY/index_polarity
KernelVersion:	5.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Active level of index input Signal Y; irrelevant in
		non-synchronous load mode.

Description:
		Discrete set of available values for the respective Signal Y
		configuration are listed in this file.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY/synchronous_mode
KernelVersion:	5.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Configure the counter associated with Signal Y for
		non-synchronous or synchronous load mode. Synchronous load mode
		cannot be selected in non-quadrature (Pulse-Direction) clock
		mode.

		non-synchronous:
			A logic low level is the active level at this index
			input. The index function (as enabled via preset_enable)
			is performed directly on the active level of the index
			input.

		synchronous:
			Intended for interfacing with encoder Index output in
			quadrature clock mode. The active level is configured
			via index_polarity. The index function (as enabled via
			preset_enable) is performed synchronously with the
			quadrature clock on the active level of the index input.
