Description:
		This directory contains the details about the device that are
		assigned in kernel (i.e. software), as opposed to the
		firmware_node directory which contains the details that are
		assigned for the device in firmware. The main attributes in the
		directory will show the properties the device has, and the
		relationship it has to some of the other devices.
