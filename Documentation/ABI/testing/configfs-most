Description: 	Interface is used to configure and connect device channels
		to component drivers.

		Attributes are visible only when configfs is mounted. To mount

Date: 		March 8, 2019
KernelVersion:  5.2
Description:
		The attributes:

		buffer_size
				configure the buffer size for this channel

		subbuffer_size
				configure the sub-buffer size for this channel
				(needed for synchronous and isochrnous data)


		num_buffers
				configure number of buffers used for this
				channel

		datatype
				configure type of data that will travel over
				this channel

		direction
				configure whether this link will be an input
				or output

		dbr_size
				configure DBR data buffer size (this is used
				for MediaLB communication only)

		packets_per_xact
				configure the number of packets that will be
				collected from the network before being
				transmitted via USB (this is used for USB
				communication only)

		device
				name of the device the link is to be attached to

		channel
				name of the channel the link is to be attached to

		comp_params
				pass parameters needed by some components

		create_link
				write '1' to this attribute to trigger the
				creation of the link. In case of speculative
				configuration, the creation is post-poned until
				a physical device is being attached to the bus.

		destroy_link
				write '1' to this attribute to destroy an
				active link
