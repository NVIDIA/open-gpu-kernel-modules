What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../path
Date:		December 2006
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		This attribute indicates the full path of ACPI namespace
		object associated with the device object.  For example,
		\_SB_.PCI0.

		This file is not present for device objects representing
		fixed ACPI hardware features (like power and sleep
		buttons).

Date:		July 2007
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		This attribute indicates the PNP IDs of the device object.
		That is acpi:HHHHHHHH:[CCCCCCC:].  Where each HHHHHHHH or
		CCCCCCCC contains device object's PNPID (_HID or _CID).

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../hid
Date:		April 2005
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		This attribute indicates the hardware ID (_HID) of the
		device object.  For example, PNP0103.
		This file is present for device objects having the _HID
		control method.

Description:
		This attribute contains the output of the device object's
		_STR control method, if present.

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../adr
Date:		October 2012
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		This attribute contains the output of the device object's
		_ADR control method, which is present for ACPI device
		objects representing devices having standard enumeration
		algorithms, such as PCI.

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../uid
Date:		October 2012
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		This attribute contains the output of the device object's
		_UID control method, if present.

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../eject
Date:		December 2006
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		Writing 1 to this attribute will trigger hot removal of
		this device object.  This file exists for every device
		object that has _EJ0 method.

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../status
Date:		Jan, 2014
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		(RO) Returns the ACPI device status: enabled, disabled or
		functioning or present, if the method _STA is present.

		The return value is a decimal integer representing the device's
		status bitmap:

		===========  ==================================================
		Bit [0]      Set if the device is present.
		Bit [1]      Set if the device is enabled and decoding its
		             resources.
		Bit [2]      Set if the device should be shown in the UI.
		Bit [3]      Set if the device is functioning properly (cleared
			     if device failed its diagnostics).
		Bit [4]      Set if the battery is present.
		Bits [31:5]  Reserved (must be cleared)
		===========  ==================================================

		If bit [0] is clear, then bit 1 must also be clear (a device
		that is not present cannot be enabled).

		Bit 0 can be clear (not present) with bit [3] set (device is
		functional).  This case is used to indicate a valid device for
		which no device driver should be loaded.

		More special cases are covered in the ACPI specification.

What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../hrv
Date:		Apr, 2016
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		(RO) Allows users to read the hardware version of non-PCI
		hardware, if the _HRV control method is present.  It is mostly
		useful for non-PCI devices because lspci can list the hardware
		version for PCI devices.
