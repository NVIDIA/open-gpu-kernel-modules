Description:

These debugfs interfaces are built by the nx-crypto driver, built in
arch/powerpc/crypto/nx.

Error Detection
===============

errors:
  A u32 providing a total count of errors since the driver was loaded. The
  only errors counted here are those returned from the hcall, H_COP_OP.

last_error:
  The most recent non-zero return code from the H_COP_OP hcall. -EBUSY is not
  recorded here (the hcall will retry until -EBUSY goes away).

last_error_pid:
  The process ID of the process who received the most recent error from the
  hcall.

Device Use
==========

aes_bytes:
  The total number of bytes encrypted using AES in any of the driver's
  supported modes.

aes_ops:
  The total number of AES operations submitted to the hardware.

sha256_bytes:
  The total number of bytes hashed by the hardware using SHA-256.

sha256_ops:
  The total number of SHA-256 operations submitted to the hardware.

sha512_bytes:
  The total number of bytes hashed by the hardware using SHA-512.

sha512_ops:
  The total number of SHA-512 operations submitted to the hardware.
