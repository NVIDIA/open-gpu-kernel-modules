What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/out_altvoltageY_frequency
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Stores the PLL frequency in Hz for channel Y.
		Reading returns the actual frequency in Hz.
		The ADF4371 has an integrated VCO with fundamendal output
		frequency ranging from 4000000000 Hz 8000000000 Hz.

		out_altvoltage0_frequency:
			A divide by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or circuit generates
			frequencies from 62500000 Hz to 8000000000 Hz.
		out_altvoltage1_frequency:
			This channel duplicates the channel 0 frequency
		out_altvoltage2_frequency:
			A frequency doubler generates frequencies from
			8000000000 Hz to 16000000000 Hz.
		out_altvoltage3_frequency:
			A frequency quadrupler generates frequencies from
			16000000000 Hz to 32000000000 Hz.

		Note: writes to one of the channels will affect the frequency of
		all the other channels, since it involves changing the VCO
		fundamental output frequency.

Description:
		Reading returns the datasheet name for channel Y::

		  out_altvoltage0_name: RF8x
		  out_altvoltage1_name: RFAUX8x
		  out_altvoltage2_name: RF16x
		  out_altvoltage3_name: RF32x

KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute allows the user to power down the PLL and it's
		RFOut buffers.
		Writing 1 causes the specified channel to power down.
		Clearing returns to normal operation.
