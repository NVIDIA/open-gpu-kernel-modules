What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/brightness
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		Writing to this file adjusts the overall brightness of
		the lightbar, separate from any color intensity. The
		valid range is 0 (off) to 255 (maximum brightness).

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/interval_msec
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		The lightbar is controlled by an embedded controller (EC),
		which also manages the keyboard, battery charging, fans,
		and other system hardware. To prevent unprivileged users
		from interfering with the other EC functions, the rate at
		which the lightbar control files can be read or written is
		limited.

		Reading this file will return the number of milliseconds
		that must elapse between accessing any of the lightbar
		functions through this interface. Going faster will simply
		block until the necessary interval has lapsed. The interval
		applies uniformly to all accesses of any kind by any user.

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/led_rgb
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		This allows you to control each LED segment. If the
		lightbar is already running one of the automatic
		sequences, you probably wonâ€™t see anything change because
		your color setting will be almost immediately replaced.
		To get useful results, you should stop the lightbar
		sequence first.

		The values written to this file are sets of four integers,
		indicating LED, RED, GREEN, BLUE. The LED number is 0 to 3
		to select a single segment, or 4 to set all four segments
		to the same value at once. The RED, GREEN, and BLUE
		numbers should be in the range 0 (off) to 255 (maximum).
		You can update more than one segment at a time by writing
		more than one set of four integers.

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/program
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		This allows you to upload and run custom lightbar sequences.

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/sequence
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		The Pixel lightbar has a number of built-in sequences
		that it displays under various conditions, such as at
		power on, shut down, or while running. Reading from this
		file displays the current sequence that the lightbar is
		displaying. Writing to this file allows you to change the
		sequence.

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/userspace_control
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		This allows you to take the control of the lightbar. This
		prevents the kernel from going through its normal
		sequences.

What:		/sys/class/chromeos/<ec-device-name>/lightbar/version
Date:		August 2015
KernelVersion:	4.2
Description:
		Show the information about the lightbar version.
