Date:		May, 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-input@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) Number of empty (no contact) frames ignored before
		acknowledging the end of activity (deactivating touch).

		When the last finger is removed from the device, it sends a
		number of empty frames. By holding off on deactivation for a few
		frames false erroneous disconnects can be tolerated, where the
		sensor may mistakenly not detect a finger that is still present.
