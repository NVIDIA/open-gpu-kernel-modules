Description:
		This is mounting matrix for motion sensors. Mounting matrix
		is a 3x3 unitary matrix. A typical mounting matrix would look like
		[0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]. Using this information, it would be
		easy to tell the relative positions among sensors as well as their
		positions relative to the board that holds these sensors. Identity matrix
		[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1] means sensor chip and device are perfectly
		aligned with each other. All axes are exactly the same.
