Contact:	Mathieu Poirier <mathieu.poirier@linaro.org>
Description:	(RW) Disables write access to the Trace RAM by stopping the
		formatter after a defined number of words have been stored
		following the trigger event. The number of 32-bit words written
		into the Trace RAM following the trigger event is equal to the
		value stored in this register+1 (from ARM ETB-TRM).
