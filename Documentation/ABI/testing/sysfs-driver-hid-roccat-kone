Date:		March 2010
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	It is possible to switch the dpi setting of the mouse with the
		press of a button.

		When read, this file returns the raw number of the actual dpi
		setting reported by the mouse. This number has to be further
		processed to receive the real dpi value:

		===== =====
		VALUE DPI
		===== =====
		1     800
		2     1200
		3     1600
		4     2000
		5     2400
		6     3200

Description:	When read, this file returns the raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the mouse. Using the integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the real version
		number the decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 138 means 1.38

Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
                press of a button. A profile holds information like button
                mappings, sensitivity, the colors of the 5 leds and light
                effects.

                When read, these files return the respective profile. The
                returned data is 975 bytes in size.

		When written, this file lets one write the respective profile
		data back to the mouse. The data has to be 975 bytes long.

		The mouse will reject invalid data, whereas the profile number
		stored in the profile doesn't need to fit the number of the
		store.

Description:	When read, this file returns the settings stored in the mouse.
		The size of the data is 36 bytes and holds information like the
		startup_profile, tcu state and calibration_data.

		When written, this file lets write settings back to the mouse.
		The data has to be 36 bytes long. The mouse will reject invalid

Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 1 to 5.

                When read, this attribute returns the number of the profile
                that's active when the mouse is powered on.

		When written, this file sets the number of the startup profile
		and the mouse activates this profile immediately.

Date:		March 2010
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The mouse has a "Tracking Control Unit" which lets the user
		calibrate the laser power to fit the mousepad surface.
		When read, this file returns the current state of the TCU,
		where 0 means off and 1 means on.

		Writing 0 in this file will switch the TCU off.

		Writing 1 in this file will start the calibration which takes
		around 6 seconds to complete and activates the TCU.

Description:	The mouse can be equipped with one of four supplied weights
		ranging from 5 to 20 grams which are recognized by the mouse
		and its value can be read out. When read, this file returns the
		raw value returned by the mouse which eases further processing
		in other software.

		The values map to the weights as follows:

		===== ======
		VALUE WEIGHT
