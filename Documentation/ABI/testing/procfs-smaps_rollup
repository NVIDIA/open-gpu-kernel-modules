Description:
		This file provides pre-summed memory information for a
		process.  The format is almost identical to /proc/pid/smaps,
		except instead of an entry for each VMA in a process,
		smaps_rollup has a single entry (tagged "[rollup]")
		for which each field is the sum of the corresponding
		fields from all the maps in /proc/pid/smaps.
		Additionally, the fields Pss_Anon, Pss_File and Pss_Shmem
		are not present in /proc/pid/smaps.  These fields represent
		the sum of the Pss field of each type (anon, file, shmem).
		For more details, see Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst
		and the procfs man page.

		Typical output looks like this::
