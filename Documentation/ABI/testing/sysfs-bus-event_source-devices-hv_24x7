Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe the magic bits
                that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

                Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
                perf_event_attr.config. All supported attributes are listed
                below::

				chip = "config:16-31"
				core  = "config:16-31"
				domain = "config:0-3"
				lpar = "config:0-15"
				offset = "config:32-63"
				vcpu = "config:16-31"

                For example::

		  PM_PB_CYC =  "domain=1,offset=0x80,chip=?,lpar=0x0"

		In this event, '?' after chip specifies that
		this value will be provided by user while running this event.

Date:		February 2014
Contact:	Linux on PowerPC Developer List <linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org>
Description:
		Provides the "long" description of a particular event as
		provided by the firmware. If firmware does not provide a
		description, no file will be created.

		Note that the event-name lacks the domain suffix appended for
		events in the events/ dir.
