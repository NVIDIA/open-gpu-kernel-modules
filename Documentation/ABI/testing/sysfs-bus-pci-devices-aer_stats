PCIe Device AER statistics
--------------------------

These attributes show up under all the devices that are AER capable. These
statistical counters indicate the errors "as seen/reported by the device".
Note that this may mean that if an endpoint is causing problems, the AER
counters may increment at its link partner (e.g. root port) because the
errors may be "seen" / reported by the link partner and not the
problematic endpoint itself (which may report all counters as 0 as it never
saw any problems).

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/aer_dev_correctable
Date:		July 2018
KernelVersion: 4.19.0
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, rajatja@google.com
Description:	List of correctable errors seen and reported by this
		PCI device using ERR_COR. Note that since multiple errors may
		be reported using a single ERR_COR message, thus
		TOTAL_ERR_COR at the end of the file may not match the actual
		total of all the errors in the file. Sample output::

		    localhost /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0 # cat aer_dev_correctable
		    Receiver Error 2
		    Bad TLP 0

		    Replay Timer Timeout 0
		    Advisory Non-Fatal 0

PCIe Rootport AER statistics
----------------------------

These attributes show up under only the rootports (or root complex event
collectors) that are AER capable. These indicate the number of error messages as
"reported to" the rootport. Please note that the rootports also transmit
(internally) the ERR_* messages for errors seen by the internal rootport PCI
device, so these counters include them and are thus cumulative of all the error
messages on the PCI hierarchy originating at that root port.
