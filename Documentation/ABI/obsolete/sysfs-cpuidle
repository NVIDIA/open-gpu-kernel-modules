What:		/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/current_governor_ro
Date:		April, 2020
Contact:	linux-pm@vger.kernel.org
Description:
	current_governor_ro shows current using cpuidle governor, but read only.
	with the update that cpuidle governor can be changed at runtime in default,
	both current_governor and current_governor_ro co-exist under
	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/ file, it's duplicate so make
	current_governor_ro obselete.
