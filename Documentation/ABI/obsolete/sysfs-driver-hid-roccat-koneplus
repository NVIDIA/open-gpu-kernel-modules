Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The integer value of this attribute ranges from 0-4.
                When read, this attribute returns the number of the actual
                profile. This value is persistent, so its equivalent to the
                profile that's active when the mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, this file sets the number of the startup profile
		and the mouse activates this profile immediately.

Date:		October 2010
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	When read, this file returns the raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the mouse. Using the integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the real version
		number the decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 121 means 1.21
		This file is readonly.
		Please read binary attribute info which contains firmware version.

		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the profile number
		contained in the data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
