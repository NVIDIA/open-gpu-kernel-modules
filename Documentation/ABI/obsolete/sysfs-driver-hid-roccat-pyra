Description:	It is possible to switch the cpi setting of the mouse with the
		press of a button.
		When read, this file returns the raw number of the actual cpi
		setting reported by the mouse. This number has to be further
		processed to receive the real dpi value:

		===== ====
		VALUE DPI
		===== ====
		1     400
		2     800
		4     1600
		===== ====

Description:	When read, this file returns the raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the mouse. Using the integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the real version
		number the decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 138 means 1.38

Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. A profile is split in settings and buttons.
		profile_buttons holds information about button layout.
		When written, this file lets one write the respective profile

		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the profile number
		contained in the data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
