Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. A profile is split into general settings and
		button settings. The buttons variable holds information about
		button layout. When written, this file lets one write the
		respective profile buttons to the mouse. The data has to be
		47 bytes long.
		The mouse will reject invalid data.
		Which profile to write is determined by the profile number
		contained in the data.
		Before reading this file, control has to be written to select
		which profile to read.
