Date:		December 2012
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. actual_profile holds number of actual profile.
		This value is persistent, so its value determines the profile
		that's active when the mouse is powered on next time.
		When written, the mouse activates the set profile immediately.
		The data has to be 3 bytes long.
		The mouse will reject invalid data.

Description:	The mouse can store 5 profiles which can be switched by the
		press of a button. A profile is split in settings and buttons.
		profile_buttons holds information about button layout.
		When written, this file lets one write the respective profile
