Description:	These files allow asserting system power cycling, switching
		power supply units on and off and system's main power domain
		shutdown.
		Expected behavior:
		When pwr_cycle is written 1: auxiliary power domain will go
		down and after short period (about 1 second) up.
		When  psu1_on or psu2_on is written 1, related unit will be
		disconnected from the power source, when written 0 - connected.
		If both are written 1 - power supplies main power domain will
		go down.
		When pwr_down is written 1, system's main power domain will go
		down.

		The files are write only.
