		read to get the audit login UID of process $pid as a
		decimal unsigned int (%u, u32).  If it is unset,
		permissions are not needed to set it.  The accessor must
		have CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL in the initial user namespace to
		write it if it has been set.  It cannot be written again
		if AUDIT_FEATURE_LOGINUID_IMMUTABLE is enabled.  It
		cannot be unset if AUDIT_FEATURE_ONLY_UNSET_LOGINUID is
		enabled.
