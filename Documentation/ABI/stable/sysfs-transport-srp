Date:		June 1, 2012
KernelVersion:	3.7
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org, linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Instructs an SRP initiator to disconnect from a target and to
		remove all LUNs imported from that target.

Date:		February 1, 2014
KernelVersion:	3.13
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org, linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Number of seconds the SCSI layer will wait after a transport
		layer error has been observed before removing a target port.
		Zero means immediate removal. Setting this attribute to "off"
		will disable the dev_loss timer.

Date:		February 1, 2014
KernelVersion:	3.13
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org, linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Number of seconds the SCSI layer will wait after a transport
		layer error has been observed before failing I/O. Zero means
		failing I/O immediately. Setting this attribute to "off" will
		disable the fast_io_fail timer.

Date:		June 27, 2007
KernelVersion:	2.6.24
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
Description:	16-byte local SRP port identifier in hexadecimal format. An
		example: 4c:49:4e:55:58:20:56:49:4f:00:00:00:00:00:00:00.

Date:		February 1, 2014
KernelVersion:	3.13
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org, linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Number of seconds the SCSI layer will wait after a reconnect
		attempt failed before retrying. Setting this attribute to
		"off" will disable time-based reconnecting.

What:		/sys/class/srp_remote_ports/port-<h>:<n>/roles
Date:		June 27, 2007
KernelVersion:	2.6.24
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
Description:	Role of the remote port. Either "SRP Initiator" or "SRP Target".

What:		/sys/class/srp_remote_ports/port-<h>:<n>/state
Date:		February 1, 2014
KernelVersion:	3.13
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org, linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:	State of the transport layer used for communication with the
		remote port. "running" if the transport layer is operational;
		"blocked" if a transport layer error has been encountered but
		the fast_io_fail_tmo timer has not yet fired; "fail-fast"
		after the fast_io_fail_tmo timer has fired and before the
		"dev_loss_tmo" timer has fired; "lost" after the
		"dev_loss_tmo" timer has fired and before the port is finally
		removed.
