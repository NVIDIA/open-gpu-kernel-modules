What:		/sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/max_retry_count
Date:		May 2011
KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Description:
		The maximum number of times the balloon driver will
		attempt to increase the balloon before giving up.  See
		also 'retry_count' below.
		A value of zero means retry forever and is the default one.

KernelVersion:	2.6.39

Contact:	Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Description:
		The current number of times that the balloon driver
		has attempted to increase the size of the balloon.
		The default value is one. With max_retry_count being
		zero (unlimited), this means that the driver will attempt
		to retry with a 'schedule_delay' delay.

KernelVersion:	2.6.39
Contact:	Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>
Description:
		The time (in seconds) to wait between attempts to
		increase the balloon.  Each time the balloon cannot be
		increased, 'schedule_delay' is increased (until
		'max_schedule_delay' is reached at which point it
		will use the max value).
