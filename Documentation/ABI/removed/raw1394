What:		raw1394 (a.k.a. "Raw IEEE1394 I/O support" for FireWire)
Date:		May 2010 (scheduled), finally removed in kernel v2.6.37
Contact:	linux1394-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Description:
	/dev/raw1394 was a character device file that allowed low-level
	access to FireWire buses.  Its major drawbacks were its inability
	to implement sensible device security policies, and its low level
	of abstraction that required userspace clients to duplicate much
	of the kernel's ieee1394 core functionality.

	Replaced by /dev/fw*, i.e. the <linux/firewire-cdev.h> ABI of
	firewire-core.

Users:
	libraw1394 (works with firewire-cdev too, transparent to library ABI
	users)
