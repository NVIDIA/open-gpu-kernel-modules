Description:
		(RO) Size of a write request to a DIMM that will not incur a
		read-modify-write cycle at the memory controller.

		When the nfit driver initializes it runs an ARS (Address Range
		Scrub) operation across every pmem range. Part of that process
		involves determining the ARS capabilities of a given address
		range. One of the capabilities that is reported is the 'Clear
		Uncorrectable Error Range Length Unit Size' (see: ACPI 6.2
		section 9.20.7.4 Function Index 1 - Query ARS Capabilities).
		This property indicates the boundary at which the NVDIMM may
		need to perform read-modify-write cycles to maintain ECC (Error
		Correcting Code) blocks.
