=============================================
Sound Blaster Audigy mixer / default DSP code
=============================================

This is based on sb-live-mixer.rst.

The EMU10K2 chips have a DSP part which can be programmed to support 
various ways of sample processing, which is described here.
(This article does not deal with the overall functionality of the 
EMU10K2 chips. See the manuals section for further details.)

The ALSA driver programs this portion of chip by default code
(can be altered later) which offers the following functionality:


Digital mixer controls
======================

These controls are built using the DSP instructions. They offer extended
functionality. Only the default build-in code in the ALSA driver is described
here. Note that the controls work as attenuators: the maximum value is the 
neutral position leaving the signal unchanged. Note that if the  same destination 
is mentioned in multiple controls, the signal is accumulated and can be wrapped 
(set to maximal or minimal value without checking of overflow).


Explanation of used abbreviations:

DAC
	digital to analog converter
ADC
	analog to digital converter
I2S
	one-way three wire serial bus for digital sound by Philips Semiconductors
        (this standard is used for connecting standalone DAC and ADC converters)
LFE
	low frequency effects (subwoofer signal)
AC97
	a chip containing an analog mixer, DAC and ADC converters
IEC958
	S/PDIF
FX-bus
	the EMU10K2 chip has an effect bus containing 64 accumulators.
        Each of the synthesizer voices can feed its output to these accumulators
        and the DSP microcontroller can operate with the resulting sum.

PCM stream related controls
===========================

Channel volume attenuation in range 0-0xffff. The maximum value (no
attenuation) is default. The channel mapping for three values is
as follows:

* 1 - left, default 0xffff (no attenuation)
* 2 - right, default 0xffff (no attenuation)

name='EMU10K1 PCM Send Routing',index 0-31
------------------------------------------
This control specifies the destination - FX-bus accumulators. There 24
values with this mapping:

* 0 -  mono, A destination (FX-bus 0-63), default 0
* 1 -  mono, B destination (FX-bus 0-63), default 1
* 2 -  mono, C destination (FX-bus 0-63), default 2
* 3 -  mono, D destination (FX-bus 0-63), default 3
