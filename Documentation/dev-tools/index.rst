Development tools for the kernel
================================

This document is a collection of documents about development tools that can
be used to work on the kernel. For now, the documents have been pulled
together without any significant effort to integrate them into a coherent
whole; patches welcome!

A brief overview of testing-specific tools can be found in
Documentation/dev-tools/testing-overview.rst
