Description
-----------

Support is provided through the sysfs w1_slave file. Each opening and
read sequence of w1_slave file initiates the read of counters and ram
available in DS2423 pages 12 - 15.

Result of each page is provided as an ASCII output where each counter
value and associated ram buffer is outpputed to own line.

Each lines will contain the values of 42 bytes read from the counter and
memory page along the crc=YES or NO for indicating whether the read operation
was successful and CRC matched.
If the operation was successful, there is also in the end of each line
a counter value expressed as an integer after c=

Meaning of 42 bytes represented is following:

 - 1 byte from ram page
 - 4 bytes for the counter value
 - 4 zero bytes
 - 2 bytes for crc16 which was calculated from the data read since the previous crc bytes
 - 31 remaining bytes from the ram page
 - crc=YES/NO indicating whether read was ok and crc matched
 - c=<int> current counter value

example from the successful read::
