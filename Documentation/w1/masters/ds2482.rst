Description
-----------

The Maxim/Dallas Semiconductor DS2482 is a I2C device that provides
one (DS2482-100) or eight (DS2482-800) 1-wire busses.


General Remarks
---------------

Valid addresses are 0x18, 0x19, 0x1a, and 0x1b.

However, the device cannot be detected without writing to the i2c bus, so no
detection is done. You should instantiate the device explicitly.

::

  $ modprobe ds2482
  $ echo ds2482 0x18 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device
