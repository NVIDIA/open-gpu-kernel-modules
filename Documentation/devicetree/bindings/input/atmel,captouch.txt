Device tree bindings for Atmel capacitive touch device, typically
an Atmel touch sensor connected to AtmegaXX MCU running firmware
based on Qtouch library.

The node for this device must be a child of a I2C controller node, as the
device communicates via I2C.

Required properties:

	compatible:	Must be "atmel,captouch".
	reg:		The I2C slave address of the device.
	interrupts:	Property describing the interrupt line the device
			is connected to. The device only has one interrupt
			source.
	linux,keycodes:	Specifies an array of numeric keycode values to
			be used for reporting button presses. The array can
			contain up to 8 entries.

Optional properties:

	autorepeat:	Enables the Linux input system's autorepeat
			feature on the input device.

Example:

	atmel-captouch@51 {
		compatible = "atmel,captouch";
		reg = <0x51>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <67 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		linux,keycodes = <BTN_0>, <BTN_1>,
			<BTN_2>, <BTN_3>,
			<BTN_4>, <BTN_5>,
			<BTN_6>, <BTN_7>;
		autorepeat;
	};
