Required properties:
- compatible: must be "technologic,ts4800-ts"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- syscon: phandle / integers array that points to the syscon node which
          describes the FPGA's syscon registers.
          - phandle to FPGA's syscon
          - offset to the touchscreen register
