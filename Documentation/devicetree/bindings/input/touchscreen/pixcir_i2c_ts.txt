* Pixcir I2C touchscreen controllers

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "pixcir,pixcir_ts" or "pixcir,pixcir_tangoc"
- reg: I2C address of the chip
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
- attb-gpio: GPIO connected to the ATTB line of the chip
- touchscreen-size-x: horizontal resolution of touchscreen (in pixels)
- touchscreen-size-y: vertical resolution of touchscreen (in pixels)

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios: GPIO connected to the RESET line of the chip
- enable-gpios: GPIO connected to the ENABLE line of the chip
- wake-gpios: GPIO connected to the WAKE line of the chip

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		pixcir_ts@5c {
			compatible = "pixcir,pixcir_ts";
			reg = <0x5c>;
			interrupts = <2 0>;
			attb-gpio = <&gpf 2 0 2>;
			touchscreen-size-x = <800>;
			touchscreen-size-y = <600>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
