* TI's Keypad Controller device tree bindings

TI's Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
event using a interrupt to the cpu.

This binding is based on the matrix-keymap binding with the following
changes:

keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns are required.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
   - "ti,omap4-keypad": For controllers compatible with omap4 keypad
      controller.

Optional Properties specific to linux:
- linux,keypad-no-autorepeat: do no enable autorepeat feature.

Example:
	keypad@4ae1c000{
		compatible = "ti,omap4-keypad";
		keypad,num-rows = <2>;
		keypad,num-columns = <8>;
		linux,keypad-no-autorepeat;
	};
