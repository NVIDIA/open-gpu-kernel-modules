    description: >
      Represents a joystick axis bound to the given ADC channel.
      For each entry in the io-channels list, one axis subnode with a matching
      reg property must be specified.

    properties:
      reg:
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1023
        description: Index of an io-channels list entry bound to this axis.

        description: >
          Minimum and maximum values produced by the axis.
          For an ABS_X axis this will be the left-most and right-most
          inclination of the joystick. If min > max, it is left to userspace to
          treat the axis as inverted.
          This property is interpreted as two signed 32 bit values.

        description: >
          Amount of noise in the input value.
          Omitting this property indicates the axis is precise.

      abs-flat:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        description: >
          Axial "deadzone", or area around the center position, where the axis
          is considered to be at rest.
          Omitting this property indicates the axis always returns to exactly
          the center position.
