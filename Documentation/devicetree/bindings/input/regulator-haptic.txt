* Regulator Haptic Device Tree Bindings

Required Properties:
 - compatible : Should be "regulator-haptic"
 - haptic-supply : Power supply to the haptic motor.
	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

 - max-microvolt : The maximum voltage value supplied to the haptic motor.
		[The unit of the voltage is a micro]

 - min-microvolt : The minimum voltage value supplied to the haptic motor.
		[The unit of the voltage is a micro]

Example:

	haptics {
		compatible = "regulator-haptic";
		haptic-supply = <&motor_regulator>;
		max-microvolt = <2700000>;
		min-microvolt = <1100000>;
	};
