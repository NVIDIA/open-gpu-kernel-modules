* D-Link DIR-685 Touchkeys

This is a I2C one-off touchkey controller based on the Cypress Semiconductor
CY8C214 MCU with some firmware in its internal 8KB flash. The circuit
board inside the router is named E119921.

The touchkey device node should be placed inside an I2C bus node.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "dlink,dir685-touchkeys"
- reg: the I2C address of the touchkeys
- interrupts: reference to the interrupt number

Example:

touchkeys@26 {
	compatible = "dlink,dir685-touchkeys";
	reg = <0x26>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
};
