   - <2>: For controllers compatible with tps65217
   - <3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>: For controllers compatible with tps65218

Examples:

&tps {
	tps65217-pwrbutton {
		compatible = "ti,tps65217-pwrbutton";
		interrupts = <2>;
	};
};

&tps {
	power-button {
		compatible = "ti,tps65218-pwrbutton";
		interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
