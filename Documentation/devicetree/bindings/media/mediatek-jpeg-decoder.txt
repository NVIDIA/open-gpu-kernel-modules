* Mediatek JPEG Decoder

Mediatek JPEG Decoder is the JPEG decode hardware present in Mediatek SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible : must be one of the following string:
	"mediatek,mt8173-jpgdec"
	"mediatek,mt7623-jpgdec", "mediatek,mt2701-jpgdec"
	"mediatek,mt2701-jpgdec"
- reg : physical base address of the jpeg decoder registers and length of
  memory mapped region.
- interrupts : interrupt number to the interrupt controller.
- clocks: device clocks, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "jpgdec-smi" and "jpgdec".
- power-domains: a phandle to the power domain, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for details.
- mediatek,larb: must contain the local arbiters in the current Socs, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/mediatek,smi-larb.yaml
  for details.
- iommus: should point to the respective IOMMU block with master port as
  argument, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.yaml
  for details.

Example:
	jpegdec: jpegdec@15004000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt2701-jpgdec";
		reg = <0 0x15004000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 143 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks =  <&imgsys CLK_IMG_JPGDEC_SMI>,
			  <&imgsys CLK_IMG_JPGDEC>;
		clock-names = "jpgdec-smi",
			      "jpgdec";
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT2701_POWER_DOMAIN_ISP>;
		mediatek,larb = <&larb2>;
		iommus = <&iommu MT2701_M4U_PORT_JPGDEC_WDMA>,
			 <&iommu MT2701_M4U_PORT_JPGDEC_BSDMA>;
	};
