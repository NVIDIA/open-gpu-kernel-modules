* Silicon Labs FM Radio receiver

The Silicon Labs Si470x is family of FM radio receivers with receive power scan
supporting 76-108 MHz, programmable through an I2C interface.
Some of them includes an RDS encoder.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should contain "silabs,si470x"
- reg: the I2C address of the device

Optional Properties:
- interrupts : The interrupt number
- reset-gpios: GPIO specifier for the chips reset line

Example:

&i2c2 {
        si470x@63 {
                compatible = "silabs,si470x";
                reg = <0x63>;

                interrupt-parent = <&gpj2>;
                interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
                reset-gpios = <&gpj2 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        };
};
