* Mediatek Video Processor Unit

Video Processor Unit is a HW video controller. It controls HW Codec including
H.264/VP8/VP9 Decode, H.264/VP8 Encode and Image Processor (scale/rotate/color convert).

Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,mt8173-vpu"
  - reg: Must contain an entry for each entry in reg-names.
  - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
    "tcm": tcm base
    "cfg_reg": Main configuration registers base
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - clocks : clock name from clock manager
  - clock-names: must be main. It is the main clock of VPU

Optional properties:
  - memory-region: phandle to a node describing memory (see
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt)
    to be used for VPU extended memory; if not present, VPU may be located
    anywhere in the memory

Example:
	vpu: vpu@10020000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-vpu";
		reg = <0 0x10020000 0 0x30000>,
		      <0 0x10050000 0 0x100>;
		reg-names = "tcm", "cfg_reg";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 166 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&topckgen TOP_SCP_SEL>;
		clock-names = "main";
	};
