Common bindings for HDMI CEC adapters

- hdmi-phandle: phandle to the HDMI controller.

- needs-hpd: if present the CEC support is only available when the HPD
  is high. Some boards only let the CEC pin through if the HPD is high,
  for example if there is a level converter that uses the HPD to power
  up or down.
