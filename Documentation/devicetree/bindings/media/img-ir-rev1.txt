This binding is for Imagination Technologies' Infrared decoder block,
specifically major revision 1.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be "img,ir-rev1"
- reg:			Physical base address of the controller and length of
			memory mapped region.
- interrupts:		The interrupt specifier to the cpu.

			2nd:	System side (fast) clock.
			3rd:	Power modulation clock.
- clock-names:		List of clock names corresponding to the clocks
			specified in the clocks property.
			Accepted clock names are:

			"sys":	System clock.
			"mod":	Power modulation clock.

Example:

	ir@2006200 {
		compatible = "img,ir-rev1";
		reg = <0x02006200 0x100>;
		interrupts = <29 4>;
		clocks = <&clk_32khz>;
		clock-names =  "core";
	};
