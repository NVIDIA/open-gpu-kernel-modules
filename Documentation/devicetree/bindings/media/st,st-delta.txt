* STMicroelectronics DELTA multi-format video decoder

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,st-delta".
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle hardware IP needed clocks, the
  number of clocks may depend on the SoC type.
  See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: names of the clocks listed in clocks property in the same order.

Example:
	delta0 {
		compatible = "st,st-delta";
		clock-names = "delta", "delta-st231", "delta-flash-promip";
		clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_VID_DMU>,
			 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_ST231_DMU>,
			 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_FLASH_PROMIP>;
	};
