STMicroelectronics stih4xx platforms

bdisp: 2D blitter for STMicroelectronics SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,stih407-bdisp".
- reg: BDISP physical address location and length.
- interrupts: BDISP interrupt number.
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle hardware IP needed clocks, the
  number of clocks may depend on the SoC type.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: names of the clocks listed in clocks property in the same order.

Example:

	bdisp0:bdisp@9f10000 {
		compatible = "st,stih407-bdisp";
		reg = <0x9f10000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 38 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		clock-names = "bdisp";
		clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_IC_BDISP_0>;
	};

Aliases:
Each BDISP should have a numbered alias in the aliases node, in the form of
bdispN, N = 0 or 1.

Example:

	aliases {
		bdisp0 = &bdisp0;
	};
