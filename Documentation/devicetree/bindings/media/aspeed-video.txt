* Device tree bindings for Aspeed Video Engine

The Video Engine (VE) embedded in the Aspeed AST2400/2500/2600 SOCs can
capture and compress video data from digital or analog sources.

Required properties:
 - compatible:		"aspeed,ast2400-video-engine" or
			"aspeed,ast2500-video-engine" or
			"aspeed,ast2600-video-engine"
 - reg:			contains the offset and length of the VE memory region
 - clocks:		clock specifiers for the syscon clocks associated with
			the VE (ordering must match the clock-names property)
 - clock-names:		"vclk" and "eclk"
 - resets:		reset specifier for the syscon reset associated with
			the VE
 - interrupts:		the interrupt associated with the VE on this platform

Optional properties:
 - memory-region:
	phandle to a memory region to allocate from, as defined in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

Example:

video-engine@1e700000 {
    compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-video-engine";
    reg = <0x1e700000 0x20000>;
    clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_VCLK>, <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_ECLK>;
    clock-names = "vclk", "eclk";
    resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_VIDEO>;
    interrupts = <7>;
    memory-region = <&video_engine_memory>;
};
