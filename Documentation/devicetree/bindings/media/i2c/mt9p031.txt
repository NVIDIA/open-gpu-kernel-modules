* Aptina 1/2.5-Inch 5Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Aptina MT9P031 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 2592H x 1944V. It is programmable through a simple
two-wire serial interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be either one among the following
	(a) "aptina,mt9p031" for mt9p031 sensor
	(b) "aptina,mt9p031m" for mt9p031m sensor

- input-clock-frequency: Input clock frequency.

- pixel-clock-frequency: Pixel clock frequency.

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: Chip reset GPIO

Example:

	i2c0@1c22000 {
		...
		...
		mt9p031@5d {
			compatible = "aptina,mt9p031";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio3 30 0>;

			port {
				mt9p031_1: endpoint {
					input-clock-frequency = <6000000>;
					pixel-clock-frequency = <96000000>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
