* Texas Instruments TV7002 video decoder

The TVP7002 device supports digitizing of video and graphics signal in RGB and
YPbPr color space.

Required Properties :
- compatible : Must be "ti,tvp7002"

Optional Properties:
- hsync-active: HSYNC Polarity configuration for the bus. Default value when
  this property is not specified is <0>.

- vsync-active: VSYNC Polarity configuration for the bus. Default value when
  this property is not specified is <0>.

- pclk-sample: Clock polarity of the bus. Default value when this property is
  not specified is <0>.

- sync-on-green-active: Active state of Sync-on-green signal property of the
  endpoint.
  0 = Normal Operation (Active Low, Default)
  1 = Inverted operation

- field-even-active: Active-high Field ID output polarity control of the bus.
  Under normal operation, the field ID output is set to logic 1 for an odd field
  (field 1) and set to logic 0 for an even field (field 0).
  0 = Normal Operation (Active Low, Default)
  1 = FID output polarity inverted

Example:

	i2c0@1c22000 {
		...
		...
		tvp7002@5c {
			compatible = "ti,tvp7002";
			reg = <0x5c>;

			port {
				tvp7002_1: endpoint {
					hsync-active = <1>;
					vsync-active = <1>;
					pclk-sample = <0>;
					sync-on-green-active = <1>;
					field-even-active = <0>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
