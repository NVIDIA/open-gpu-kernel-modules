* Analog Devices adv7343 video encoder

The ADV7343 are high speed, digital-to-analog video encoders in a 64-lead LQFP
package. Six high speed, 3.3 V, 11-bit video DACs provide support for composite
(CVBS), S-Video (Y-C), and component (YPrPb/RGB) analog outputs in standard
definition (SD), enhanced definition (ED), or high definition (HD) video
formats.

Required Properties :
- compatible: Must be "adi,adv7343"

Optional Properties :
- adi,power-mode-sleep-mode: on enable the current consumption is reduced to
			      micro ampere level. All DACs and the internal PLL
			      circuit are disabled.
- adi,power-mode-pll-ctrl: PLL and oversampling control. This control allows
			   internal PLL 1 circuit to be powered down and the
			   oversampling to be switched off.
- ad,adv7343-power-mode-dac: array configuring the power on/off DAC's 1..6,
			      0 = OFF and 1 = ON, Default value when this
			      property is not specified is <0 0 0 0 0 0>.
- ad,adv7343-sd-config-dac-out: array configure SD DAC Output's 1 and 2, 0 = OFF
				 and 1 = ON, Default value when this property is
				 not specified is <0 0>.

Example:

i2c0@1c22000 {
	...
	...

	adv7343@2a {
		compatible = "adi,adv7343";
		reg = <0x2a>;

		port {
			adv7343_1: endpoint {
					adi,power-mode-sleep-mode;
					adi,power-mode-pll-ctrl;
					/* Use DAC1..3, DAC6 */
					adi,dac-enable = <1 1 1 0 0 1>;
					/* Use SD DAC output 1 */
					adi,sd-dac-enable = <1 0>;
			};
		};
	};
	...
};
