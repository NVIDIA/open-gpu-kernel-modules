description: |
  The MAX9286 deserializer receives video data on up to 4 Gigabit Multimedia
  Serial Links (GMSL) and outputs them on a CSI-2 D-PHY port using up to 4 data
  lanes.

  In addition to video data, the GMSL links carry a bidirectional control
  channel that encapsulates I2C messages. The MAX9286 forwards all I2C traffic
  not addressed to itself to the other side of the links, where a GMSL
  serializer will output it on a local I2C bus. In the other direction all I2C
  traffic received over GMSL by the MAX9286 is output on the local I2C bus.

    description: |
      Initial amplitude of the reverse control channel, in micro volts.

      The initial amplitude shall be adjusted to a value compatible with the
      configuration of the connected remote serializer.

      Some camera modules (for example RDACM20) include an on-board MCU that
      pre-programs the embedded serializer with power supply noise immunity
      (high-threshold) enabled. A typical value of the deserializer's reverse
      channel amplitude to communicate with pre-programmed serializers is
      170000 micro volts.

      A typical value for the reverse channel amplitude to communicate with
      a remote serializer whose high-threshold noise immunity is not enabled
      is 100000 micro volts
