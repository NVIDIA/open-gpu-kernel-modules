description: |-
  The OV2680 color sensor is a low voltage, high performance 1/5 inch UXGA (2
  megapixel) CMOS image sensor that provides a single-chip UXGA (1600 x 1200)
  camera. It provides full-frame, sub-sampled, or windowed 10-bit images in
  various formats via the control of the Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB)
  interface. The OV2680 has an image array capable of operating at up to 30
  frames per second (fps) in UXGA resolution.
