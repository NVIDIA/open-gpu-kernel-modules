MT9M001: 1/2-Inch Megapixel Digital Image Sensor

The MT9M001 is an SXGA-format with a 1/2-inch CMOS active-pixel digital
image sensor. It is programmable through I2C interface.

Required Properties:

- compatible: shall be "onnn,mt9m001".
- clocks: reference to the master clock into sensor

Optional Properties:

- reset-gpios: GPIO handle which is connected to the reset pin of the chip.
  Active low.
- standby-gpios: GPIO handle which is connected to the standby pin of the chip.
  Active high.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node with one 'endpoint' child
sub-node for its digital output video port, in accordance with the video
interface bindings defined in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

Example:

	&i2c1 {
		camera-sensor@5d {
			compatible = "onnn,mt9m001";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			standby-gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			clocks = <&camera_clk>;
			port {
				mt9m001_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vcap_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
