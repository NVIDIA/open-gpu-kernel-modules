* Toshiba TC358743 HDMI-RX to MIPI CSI2-TX Bridge

The Toshiba TC358743 HDMI-RX to MIPI CSI2-TX (H2C) is a bridge that converts
a HDMI stream to MIPI CSI-2 TX. It is programmable through I2C.

Required Properties:

- compatible: value should be "toshiba,tc358743"
- clocks, clock-names: should contain a phandle link to the reference clock
		       source, the clock input is named "refclk".

Optional Properties:

- reset-gpios: gpio phandle GPIO connected to the reset pin
- interrupts: GPIO connected to the interrupt pin
- data-lanes: should be <1 2 3 4> for four-lane operation,
	      or <1 2> for two-lane operation
- clock-lanes: should be <0>
- clock-noncontinuous: Presence of this boolean property decides whether the
		       MIPI CSI-2 clock is continuous or non-continuous.
- link-frequencies: List of allowed link frequencies in Hz. Each frequency is
		    expressed as a 64-bit big-endian integer. The frequency
		    is half of the bps per lane due to DDR transmission.

For further information on the MIPI CSI-2 endpoint node properties, see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	tc358743@f {
		compatible = "toshiba,tc358743";
		reg = <0x0f>;
		clocks = <&hdmi_osc>;
		clock-names = "refclk";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio6 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		interrupts = <5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		port {
			tc358743_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_csi2_in>;
				data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
				clock-lanes = <0>;
				clock-noncontinuous;
				link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <297000000>;
			};
		};
	};
