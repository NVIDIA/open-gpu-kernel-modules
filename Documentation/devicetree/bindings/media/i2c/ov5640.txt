* Omnivision OV5640 MIPI CSI-2 / parallel sensor

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ovti,ov5640"
- clocks: reference to the xclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xclk".
- DOVDD-supply: Digital I/O voltage supply, 1.8 volts
- AVDD-supply: Analog voltage supply, 2.8 volts
- DVDD-supply: Digital core voltage supply, 1.5 volts

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the reset pin, if any.
	       This is an active low signal to the OV5640.
- powerdown-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the powerdown pin,
		   if any. This is an active high signal to the OV5640.
- rotation: as defined in
	    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt,
	    valid values are 0 (sensor mounted upright) and 180 (sensor
	    mounted upside down).

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

OV5640 can be connected to a MIPI CSI-2 bus or a parallel bus endpoint.

Endpoint node required properties for CSI-2 connection are:
- remote-endpoint: a phandle to the bus receiver's endpoint node.
- clock-lanes: should be set to <0> (clock lane on hardware lane 0)
- data-lanes: should be set to <1> or <1 2> (one or two CSI-2 lanes supported)

Endpoint node required properties for parallel connection are:
- remote-endpoint: a phandle to the bus receiver's endpoint node.
- bus-width: shall be set to <8> for 8 bits parallel bus
	     or <10> for 10 bits parallel bus
- data-shift: shall be set to <2> for 8 bits parallel bus
	      (lines 9:2 are used) or <0> for 10 bits parallel bus
- hsync-active: active state of the HSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.
- vsync-active: active state of the VSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.
- pclk-sample: sample data on rising (1) or falling (0) edge of the pixel clock
	       signal.
