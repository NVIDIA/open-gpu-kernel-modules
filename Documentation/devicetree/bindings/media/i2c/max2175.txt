Maxim Integrated MAX2175 RF to Bits tuner
-----------------------------------------

The MAX2175 IC is an advanced analog/digital hybrid-radio receiver with
RF to BitsÂ® front-end designed for software-defined radio solutions.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: "maxim,max2175" for MAX2175 RF-to-bits tuner.
- clocks: clock specifier.
- port: child port node corresponding to the I2S output, in accordance with
	the video interface bindings defined in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The port
	node must contain at least one endpoint.

Optional properties:
--------------------
- maxim,master	      : phandle to the master tuner if it is a slave. This
			is used to define two tuners in diversity mode
			(1 master, 1 slave). By default each tuner is an
			individual master.
- maxim,refout-load   : load capacitance value (in picofarads) on reference
			output drive level. The possible load values are:
			 0 (default - refout disabled)
			10
			20
			30
			40
			60
			70
- maxim,am-hiz-filter : empty property indicates the AM Hi-Z filter is used
			in this hardware for AM antenna input.

Example:
--------

Board specific DTS file

/* Fixed XTAL clock node */
maxim_xtal: clock {
	compatible = "fixed-clock";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency = <36864000>;
};

/* A tuner device instance under i2c bus */
max2175_0: tuner@60 {
	compatible = "maxim,max2175";
	reg = <0x60>;
	clocks = <&maxim_xtal>;
	maxim,refout-load = <10>;

	port {
		max2175_0_ep: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&slave_rx_device>;
		};
	};
