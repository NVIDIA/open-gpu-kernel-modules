description: |-
  The Sony imx219 is a 1/4.0-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
  with an active array size of 3280H x 2464V. It is programmable through
  I2C interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x10 as per sensor data sheet.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 2 or
  4 data lanes.

              The sensor supports either two-lane, or four-lane operation.
              If this property is omitted four-lane operation is assumed.
              For two-lane operation the property must be set to <1 2>.
