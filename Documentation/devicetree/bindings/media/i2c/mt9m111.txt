Micron 1.3Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Micron MT9M111 is a CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with an active
array size of 1280H x 1024V. It is programmable through a simple two-wire serial
interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "micron,mt9m111"
- clocks: reference to the master clock.
- clock-names: shall be "mclk".

The device node must contain one 'port' child node with one 'endpoint' child
sub-node for its digital output video port, in accordance with the video
interface bindings defined in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

Optional endpoint properties:
- pclk-sample: For information see ../video-interfaces.txt. The value is set to
  0 if it isn't specified.

Example:

	i2c_master {
		mt9m111@5d {
			compatible = "micron,mt9m111";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			clocks = <&mclk>;
			clock-names = "mclk";

			port {
				mt9m111_1: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&pxa_camera>;
					pclk-sample = <1>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
