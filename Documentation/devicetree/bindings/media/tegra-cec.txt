* Tegra HDMI CEC hardware

The HDMI CEC module is present in Tegra SoCs and its purpose is to
handle communication between HDMI connected devices over the CEC bus.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be one of the following:
	"nvidia,tegra114-cec"
	"nvidia,tegra124-cec"
	"nvidia,tegra210-cec"
  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.
  - interrupts : HDMI CEC interrupt number to the CPU.
  - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to HDMI CEC clock.
  - clock-names : from common clock binding: must contain "cec",
		  corresponding to the entry in the clocks property.
  - hdmi-phandle : phandle to the HDMI controller, see also cec.txt.

Example:

cec@70015000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-cec";
	reg = <0x0 0x70015000 0x0 0x00001000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_CEC>;
	clock-names = "cec";
};
