Xilinx Video Timing Controller (VTC)
------------------------------------

The Video Timing Controller is a general purpose video timing generator and
detector.

Required properties:

  - compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-tc-6.1".

  - reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

  - clocks: Must contain a clock specifier for the VTC core and timing
    interfaces clock.

Optional properties:

  - xlnx,detector: The VTC has a timing detector
  - xlnx,generator: The VTC has a timing generator

  At least one of the xlnx,detector and xlnx,generator properties must be
  specified.


Example:

	vtc: vtc@43c40000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-tc-6.1";
		reg = <0x43c40000 0x10000>;

		clocks = <&clkc 15>;
		xlnx,generator;
	};
