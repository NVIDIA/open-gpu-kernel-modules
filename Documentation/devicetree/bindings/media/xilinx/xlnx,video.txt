Xilinx Video IP Pipeline (VIPP)
-------------------------------

General concept
---------------

Xilinx video IP pipeline processes video streams through one or more Xilinx
video IP cores. Each video IP core is represented as documented in video.txt
and IP core specific documentation, xlnx,v-*.txt, in this directory. The DT
node of the VIPP represents as a top level node of the pipeline and defines
mappings between DMAs and the video IP cores.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,video".

- dmas, dma-names: List of one DMA specifier and identifier string (as defined
  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt) per port. Each port
  requires a DMA channel with the identifier string set to "port" followed by
  the port index.

- ports: Video port, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.

Required port properties:

- direction: should be either "input" or "output" depending on the direction
  of stream.

Example:

	video_cap {
		compatible = "xlnx,video";
		dmas = <&vdma_1 1>, <&vdma_3 1>;
		dma-names = "port0", "port1";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				direction = "input";
				vcap0_in0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&scaler0_out>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				direction = "input";
				vcap0_in1: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&switch_out1>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
