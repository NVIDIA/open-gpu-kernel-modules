Freescale Video Data Order Adapter
==================================

The Video Data Order Adapter (VDOA) is present on the i.MX6q. Its sole purpose
is to reorder video data from the macroblock tiled order produced by the CODA
960 VPU to the conventional raster-scan order for scanout.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "fsl,imx6q-vdoa"
- reg: the register base and size for the device registers
- interrupts: the VDOA interrupt
- clocks: the vdoa clock

Example:

vdoa@21e4000 {
        compatible = "fsl,imx6q-vdoa";
        reg = <0x021e4000 0x4000>;
        interrupts = <0 18 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_VDOA>;
};
