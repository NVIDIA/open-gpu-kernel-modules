st-hva: multi-format video encoder for STMicroelectronics SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,st-hva".
- reg: HVA physical address location and length, esram address location and
  length.
- reg-names: names of the registers listed in registers property in the same
  order.
- interrupts: HVA interrupt number.
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle hardware IP needed clocks, the
  number of clocks may depend on the SoC type.
  See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: names of the clocks listed in clocks property in the same order.

Example:
	hva@8c85000{
		compatible = "st,st-hva";
		reg = <0x8c85000 0x400>, <0x6000000 0x40000>;
		reg-names = "hva_registers", "hva_esram";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 58 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
			     <GIC_SPI 59 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		clock-names = "clk_hva";
		clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_HVA>;
	};
