* ASPEED AST2400 and AST2500 coprocessor interrupt controller

This file describes the bindings for the interrupt controller present
in the AST2400 and AST2500 BMC SoCs which provides interrupt to the
ColdFire coprocessor.

It is not a normal interrupt controller and it would be rather
inconvenient to create an interrupt tree for it as it somewhat shares
some of the same sources as the main ARM interrupt controller but with
different numbers.

The AST2500 supports a SW generated interrupt

Required properties:
- reg: address and length of the register for the device.
- compatible: "aspeed,cvic" and one of:
		"aspeed,ast2400-cvic"
	      or
		"aspeed,ast2500-cvic"

- valid-sources: One cell, bitmap of supported sources for the implementation

Optional properties;
- copro-sw-interrupts: List of interrupt numbers that can be used as
		       SW interrupts from the ARM to the coprocessor.
		       (AST2500 only)

Example:

	cvic: copro-interrupt-controller@1e6c2000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-cvic";
		valid-sources = <0xffffffff>;
		copro-sw-interrupts = <1>;
		reg = <0x1e6c2000 0x80>;
	};
