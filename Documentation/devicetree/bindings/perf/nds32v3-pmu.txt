* NDS32 Performance Monitor Units

NDS32 core have a PMU for counting cpu and cache events like cache misses.
The NDS32 PMU representation in the device tree should be done as under:

Required properties:

- compatible :
	"andestech,nds32v3-pmu"

- interrupts : The interrupt number for NDS32 PMU is 13.

Example:
pmu{
	compatible = "andestech,nds32v3-pmu";
	interrupts = <13>;
}
