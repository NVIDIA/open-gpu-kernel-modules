title: Common Properties for Parallel AT attachment (PATA) controllers

maintainers:

description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to most Parallel
  ATA (PATA, also known as IDE) AT attachment storage devices.
  It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification by itself but is
  meant to be referenced by device tree bindings.

  The PATA (IDE) controller-specific device tree bindings are responsible for
  defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^ide(@.*)?$"
    description:
      Specifies the host controller node. PATA host controller nodes are named
      "ide".

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

patternProperties:
  "^ide-port@[0-1]$":
    description: |
      DT nodes for ports connected on the PATA host. The master drive will have
      ID number 0 and the slave drive will have ID number 1. The PATA port
      nodes will be named "ide-port".
    type: object

    properties:
      reg:
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 1
        description:
          The ID number of the drive port, 0 for the master port and 1 for the
          slave port.
