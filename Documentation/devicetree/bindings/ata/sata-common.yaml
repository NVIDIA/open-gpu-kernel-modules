title: Common Properties for Serial AT attachment (SATA) controllers

description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to most Serial
  AT attachment (SATA) storage devices. It doesn't constitute a device tree
  binding specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by device
  tree bindings.

  The SATA controller-specific device tree bindings are responsible for
  defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^sata(@.*)?$"
    description:
      Specifies the host controller node. SATA host controller nodes are named
      "sata"

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":

      DT nodes for ports connected on the SATA host. The SATA port
      nodes will be named "sata-port".

        description:
          The ID number of the drive port SATA can potentially use a port
          multiplier making it possible to connect up to 15 disks to a single
          SATA port.
