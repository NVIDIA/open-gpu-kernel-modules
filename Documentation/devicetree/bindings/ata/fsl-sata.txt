* Freescale 8xxx/3.0 Gb/s SATA nodes

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA port should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains 2 entries, first is
		 "fsl,CHIP-sata", where CHIP is the processor
		 (mpc8315, mpc8379, etc.) and the second is
		 "fsl,pq-sata"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- cell-index        : controller index.
                          1 for controller @ 0x18000
                          2 for controller @ 0x19000
                          3 for controller @ 0x1a000
                          4 for controller @ 0x1b000

Optional properties:
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Example:
	sata@18000 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8379-sata", "fsl,pq-sata";
		reg = <0x18000 0x1000>;
		cell-index = <1>;
		interrupts = <2c 8>;
		interrupt-parent = < &ipic >;
	};
