* Texas Instruments - LM3697 Highly Efficient White LED Driver

The LM3697 11-bit LED driver provides high-
performance backlight dimming for 1, 2, or 3 series
LED strings while delivering up to 90% efficiency.

This device is suitable for display and keypad lighting

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		"ti,lm3697"
	- reg :  I2C slave address
	- #address-cells : 1
	- #size-cells : 0

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpios : GPIO pin to enable/disable the device
	- vled-supply : LED supply

Required child properties:
	- reg : 0 - LED is Controlled by bank A
		1 - LED is Controlled by bank B
	- led-sources : Indicates which HVLED string is associated to which
			control bank.  This is a zero based property so
			HVLED1 = 0, HVLED2 = 1, HVLED3 = 2.
			Additional information is contained
			in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Optional child properties:
	- ti,brightness-resolution - see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/ti-lmu.txt
	- ramp-up-us: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/ti-lmu.txt
	- ramp-down-us: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/ti-lmu.txt
	- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger :
	   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

HVLED string 1 and 3 are controlled by control bank A and HVLED 2 string is
controlled by control bank B.

	compatible = "ti,lm3697";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

		ti,brightness-resolution = <2047>;
		ramp-up-us = <5000>;
		ramp-down-us = <1000>;
		label = "white:first_backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};

	led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		led-sources = <1>;
		ti,brightness-resolution = <255>;
		ramp-up-us = <500>;
		ramp-down-us = <1000>;
