description:
  Backlight devices provide backlight for different types of graphical
  displays. They are typically but not necessarily implemented using a white
  LED powered by a boost converter.

properties:
  default-brightness:
    description:
      The default brightness that should be applied to the LED by the operating
      system on start-up. The brightness should not exceed the brightness the
      LED can provide.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  max-brightness:
    description:
      Normally the maximum brightness is determined by the hardware and this
      property is not required. This property is used to put a software limit
      on the brightness apart from what the driver says, as it could happen
      that a LED can be made so bright that it gets damaged or causes damage
      due to restrictions in a specific system, such as mounting conditions.
