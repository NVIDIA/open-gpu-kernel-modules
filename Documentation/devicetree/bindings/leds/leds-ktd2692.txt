* Kinetic Technologies - KTD2692 Flash LED Driver

KTD2692 is the ideal power solution for high-power flash LEDs.
It uses ExpressWire single-wire programming for maximum flexibility.

The ExpressWire interface through CTRL pin can control LED on/off and
enable/disable the IC, Movie(max 1/3 of Flash current) / Flash mode current,
Flash timeout, LVP(low voltage protection).

Also, When the AUX pin is pulled high while CTRL pin is high,
LED current will be ramped up to the flash-mode current level.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "kinetic,ktd2692".
- ctrl-gpios : Specifier of the GPIO connected to CTRL pin.
- aux-gpios : Specifier of the GPIO connected to AUX pin.

Optional properties:
- vin-supply : "vin" LED supply (2.7V to 5.5V).
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

A discrete LED element connected to the device must be represented by a child
node - See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Required properties for flash LED child nodes:
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- led-max-microamp : Minimum Threshold for Timer protection
  is defined internally (Maximum 300mA).
- flash-max-microamp : Flash LED maximum current
  Formula : I(mA) = 15000 / Rset.
- flash-max-timeout-us : Flash LED maximum timeout.

Optional properties for flash LED child nodes:
- label : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

ktd2692 {
	compatible = "kinetic,ktd2692";
	ctrl-gpios = <&gpc0 1 0>;
	aux-gpios = <&gpc0 2 0>;
	vin-supply = <&vbat>;

	flash-led {
		label = "ktd2692-flash";
		led-max-microamp = <300000>;
		flash-max-microamp = <1500000>;
		flash-max-timeout-us = <1835000>;
	};
};
