Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through gpio pin which is used as
remote controller transmitter.

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "gpio-ir-tx".
	- gpios :  Should specify the IR LED GPIO, see "gpios property" in
	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.  Active low LEDs
	  should be indicated using flags in the GPIO specifier.

Example:
	irled@0 {
		compatible = "gpio-ir-tx";
		gpios = <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};
