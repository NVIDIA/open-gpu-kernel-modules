Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through pwm pin which is used as
remote controller transmitter.

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "pwm-ir-tx".
	- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id)
	  and to specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;

Example:
	irled {
		compatible = "pwm-ir-tx";
		pwms = <&pwm0 0 10000000>;
	};
