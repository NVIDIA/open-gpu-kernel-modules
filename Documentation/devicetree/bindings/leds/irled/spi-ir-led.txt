Device tree bindings for IR LED connected through SPI bus which is used as
remote controller.

The IR LED switch is connected to the MOSI line of the SPI device and the data
are delivered thourgh that.

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "ir-spi-led".

Optional properties:
	- duty-cycle: 8 bit value that represents the percentage of one period
	  in which the signal is active.  It can be 50, 60, 70, 75, 80 or 90.
	- led-active-low: boolean value that specifies whether the output is
	  negated with a NOT gate.
	- power-supply: specifies the power source. It can either be a regulator
	  or a gpio which enables a regulator, i.e. a regulator-fixed as
	  described in
	  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/fixed-regulator.yaml

Example:

	irled@0 {
		compatible = "ir-spi-led";
		reg = <0x0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <5000000>;
		power-supply = <&vdd_led>;
		led-active-low;
		duty-cycle = /bits/ 8 <60>;
	};
