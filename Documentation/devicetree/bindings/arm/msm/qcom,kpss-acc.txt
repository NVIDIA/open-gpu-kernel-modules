Krait Processor Sub-system (KPSS) Application Clock Controller (ACC)

The KPSS ACC provides clock, power domain, and reset control to a Krait CPU.
There is one ACC register region per CPU within the KPSS remapped region as
well as an alias register region that remaps accesses to the ACC associated
with the CPU accessing the region.

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be one of:
			"qcom,kpss-acc-v1"
			"qcom,kpss-acc-v2"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: the first element specifies the base address and size of
		    the register region. An optional second element specifies
		    the base address and size of the alias register region.

- clocks:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
        Definition: reference to the pll parents.

- clock-names:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <stringlist>
        Definition: must be "pll8_vote", "pxo".

- clock-output-names:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Name of the output clock. Typically acpuX_aux where X is a
		    CPU number starting at 0.

Example:

	clock-controller@2088000 {
		compatible = "qcom,kpss-acc-v2";
		reg = <0x02088000 0x1000>,
		      <0x02008000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&gcc PLL8_VOTE>, <&gcc PXO_SRC>;
		clock-names = "pll8_vote", "pxo";
		clock-output-names = "acpu0_aux";
	};
