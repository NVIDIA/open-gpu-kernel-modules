Krait Processor Sub-system (KPSS) Global Clock Controller (GCC)

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be one of the following. The generic compatible
			"qcom,kpss-gcc" should also be included.
			"qcom,kpss-gcc-ipq8064", "qcom,kpss-gcc"
			"qcom,kpss-gcc-apq8064", "qcom,kpss-gcc"
			"qcom,kpss-gcc-msm8974", "qcom,kpss-gcc"
			"qcom,kpss-gcc-msm8960", "qcom,kpss-gcc"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size of the register region

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to the pll parents.

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "pll8_vote", "pxo".

- clock-output-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Name of the output clock. Typically acpu_l2_aux indicating
		    an L2 cache auxiliary clock.

Example:

	l2cc: clock-controller@2011000 {
		compatible = "qcom,kpss-gcc-ipq8064", "qcom,kpss-gcc";
		reg = <0x2011000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&gcc PLL8_VOTE>, <&gcc PXO_SRC>;
		clock-names = "pll8_vote", "pxo";
		clock-output-names = "acpu_l2_aux";
	};
