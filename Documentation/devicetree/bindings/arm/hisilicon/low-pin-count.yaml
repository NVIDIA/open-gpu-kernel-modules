title: Hisilicon HiP06 Low Pin Count device

description: |
  Hisilicon HiP06 SoCs implement a Low Pin Count (LPC) controller, which
  provides I/O access to some legacy ISA devices.
  HiP06 is based on arm64 architecture where there is no I/O space. So, the
  I/O ports here are not CPU addresses, and there is no 'ranges' property in
  LPC device node.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: '^isa@[0-9a-f]+$'
    description: |
      The node name before '@' must be "isa" to represent the binding stick
      to the ISA/EISA binding specification.

  compatible:
    enum:
      - hisilicon,hip06-lpc
      - hisilicon,hip07-lpc

  reg:

  '#address-cells':
    const: 2

  '#size-cells':
