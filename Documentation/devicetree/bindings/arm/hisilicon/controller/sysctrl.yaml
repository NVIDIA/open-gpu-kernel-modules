description: |
  The Hisilicon system controller is used on many Hisilicon boards, it can be
  used to assist the slave core startup, reboot the system, etc.

  There are some variants of the Hisilicon system controller, such as HiP01,
  Hi3519, Hi6220 system controller, each of them is mostly compatible with the
  Hisilicon system controller, but some same registers located at different
  offset. In addition, the HiP01 system controller has some specific control
  registers for HIP01 SoC family, such as slave core boot.

  The compatible names of each system controller are as follows:
  Hisilicon system controller   --> hisilicon,sysctrl
  HiP01     system controller   --> hisilicon,hip01-sysctrl
  Hi6220    system controller   --> hisilicon,hi6220-sysctrl
  Hi3519    system controller   --> hisilicon,hi3519-sysctrl
