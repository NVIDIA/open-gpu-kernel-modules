NVIDIA Tegra Activity Monitor

The activity monitor block collects statistics about the behaviour of other
components in the system. This information can be used to derive the rate at
which the external memory needs to be clocked in order to serve all requests
from the monitored clients.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra<chip>-actmon"
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: standard interrupt property
- clocks: Must contain a phandle and clock specifier pair for each entry in
clock-names. See ../../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - actmon
  - emc
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names. See
../../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - actmon
- operating-points-v2: See ../bindings/opp/opp.txt for details.
- interconnects: Should contain entries for memory clients sitting on
                 MC->EMC memory interconnect path.
- interconnect-names: Should include name of the interconnect path for each
                      interconnect entry. Consult TRM documentation for
                      information about available memory clients, see MEMORY
                      CONTROLLER section.

For each opp entry in 'operating-points-v2' table:
- opp-supported-hw: bitfield indicating SoC speedo ID mask
- opp-peak-kBps: peak bandwidth of the memory channel

Example:
	dfs_opp_table: opp-table {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2";

		opp@12750000 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <12750000>;
			opp-supported-hw = <0x000F>;
			opp-peak-kBps = <51000>;
		};
		...
	};

	actmon@6000c800 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-actmon";
		reg = <0x0 0x6000c800 0x0 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 45 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_ACTMON>,
			 <&tegra_car TEGRA124_CLK_EMC>;
		clock-names = "actmon", "emc";
		resets = <&tegra_car 119>;
		reset-names = "actmon";
		operating-points-v2 = <&dfs_opp_table>;
		interconnects = <&mc TEGRA124_MC_MPCORER &emc>;
		interconnect-names = "cpu";
	};
