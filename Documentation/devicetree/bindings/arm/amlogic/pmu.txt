Amlogic Meson8 and Meson8b power-management-unit:
-------------------------------------------------

The pmu is used to turn off and on different power domains of the SoCs
This includes the power to the CPU cores.

Required node properties:
- compatible value : depending on the SoC this should be one of:
			"amlogic,meson8-pmu"
			"amlogic,meson8b-pmu"
- reg : physical base address and the size of the registers window

Example:

	pmu@c81000e4 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8b-pmu", "syscon";
		reg = <0xc81000e0 0x18>;
	};
