SP810 System Controller
-----------------------

Required properties:

- compatible:	standard compatible string for a Primecell peripheral,
		see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/primecell.yaml
		for more details
		should be: "arm,sp810", "arm,primecell"

- reg:		standard registers property, physical address and size
		of the control registers

- clock-names:	from the common clock bindings, for more details see
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt;
		should be: "refclk", "timclk", "apb_pclk"

- clocks:	from the common clock bindings, phandle and clock
		specifier pairs for the entries of clock-names property

- #clock-cells: from the common clock bindings;
		should be: <1>

- clock-output-names: from the common clock bindings;
		should be: "timerclken0", "timerclken1", "timerclken2", "timerclken3"

- assigned-clocks: from the common clock binding;
		should be: clock specifier for each output clock of this
		provider node

- assigned-clock-parents: from the common clock binding;
		should be: phandle of input clock listed in clocks
		property with the highest frequency

Example:
	v2m_sysctl: sysctl@20000 {
		compatible = "arm,sp810", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x020000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&v2m_refclk32khz>, <&v2m_refclk1mhz>, <&smbclk>;
		clock-names = "refclk", "timclk", "apb_pclk";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "timerclken0", "timerclken1", "timerclken2", "timerclken3";
		assigned-clocks = <&v2m_sysctl 0>, <&v2m_sysctl 1>, <&v2m_sysctl 3>, <&v2m_sysctl 3>;
		assigned-clock-parents = <&v2m_refclk1mhz>, <&v2m_refclk1mhz>, <&v2m_refclk1mhz>, <&v2m_refclk1mhz>;

	};
