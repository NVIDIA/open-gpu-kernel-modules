description: |
  MStar/SigmaStar's Armv7 SoCs have a pipeline in the interface
  between the CPU and memory. This means that before DMA capable
  devices are allowed to run the pipeline must be flushed to ensure
  everything is in memory.

  The l3bridge region contains registers that allow such a flush
  to be triggered.

  This node is used by the platform code to find where the registers
  are and install a barrier that triggers the required pipeline flush.
