Freescale Vybrid Miscellaneous System Control - Interrupt Router

The MSCM IP contains multiple sub modules, this binding describes the second
block of registers which control the interrupt router. The interrupt router
allows to configure the recipient of each peripheral interrupt. Furthermore
it controls the directed processor interrupts. The module is available in all
Vybrid SoC's but is only really useful in dual core configurations (VF6xx
which comes with a Cortex-A5/Cortex-M4 combination).

Required properties:
- compatible:		"fsl,vf610-mscm-ir"
- reg:			the register range of the MSCM Interrupt Router
- fsl,cpucfg:		The handle to the MSCM CPU configuration node, required
			to get the current CPU ID
- interrupt-controller:	Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells:	Two cells, interrupt number and cells.
			The hardware interrupt number according to interrupt
			assignment of the interrupt router is required.
			Flags get passed only when using GIC as parent. Flags
			encoding as documented by the GIC bindings.

Example:
	mscm_ir: interrupt-controller@40001800 {
		compatible = "fsl,vf610-mscm-ir";
		reg = <0x40001800 0x400>;
		fsl,cpucfg = <&mscm_cpucfg>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	}
