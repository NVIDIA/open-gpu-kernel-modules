description: |
  The Multi-System Mode Controller (MSMC) is responsible for sequencing
  the MCU into and out of all stop and run power modes. Specifically, it
  monitors events to trigger transitions between power modes while
  controlling the power, clocks, and memories of the MCU to achieve the
  power consumption and functionality of that mode.

  The WFI or WFE instruction is used to invoke a Sleep, Deep Sleep or
  Standby modes for either Cortex family. Run, Wait, and Stop are the
  common terms used for the primary operating modes of Kinetis
  microcontrollers.
