Freescale SCFG

SCFG is the supplemental configuration unit, that provides SoC specific
configuration and status registers for the chip. Such as getting PEX port
status.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain a chip-specific compatible string,
	Chip-specific strings are of the form "fsl,<chip>-scfg",
	The following <chip>s are known to be supported:
	ls1012a, ls1021a, ls1043a, ls1046a, ls2080a.

  - reg: should contain base address and length of SCFG memory-mapped registers

Example:
	scfg: scfg@1570000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-scfg";
		reg = <0x0 0x1570000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};
