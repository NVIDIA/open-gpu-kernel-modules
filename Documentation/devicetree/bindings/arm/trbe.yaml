description: |
  Arm Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE) is a per CPU component
  for storing trace generated on the CPU to memory. It is
  accessed via CPU system registers. The software can verify
  if it is permitted to use the component by checking the
  TRBIDR register.

  $nodename:
    const: "trbe"

      - const: arm,trace-buffer-extension

    description: |
       Exactly 1 PPI must be listed. For heterogeneous systems where
       TRBE is only supported on a subset of the CPUs, please consult
       the arm,gic-v3 binding for details on describing a PPI partition.
    maxItems: 1

required:
  - compatible
