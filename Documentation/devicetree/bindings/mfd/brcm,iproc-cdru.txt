Broadcom iProc Chip Device Resource Unit (CDRU)

Various Broadcom iProc SoCs have a set of registers that provide various
chip specific device and resource configurations. This node allows access to
these CDRU registers via syscon.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain:
		"brcm,sr-cdru", "syscon" for Stingray
- reg: base address and range of the CDRU registers

Example:
	cdru: syscon@6641d000 {
		compatible = "brcm,sr-cdru", "syscon";
		reg = <0 0x6641d000 0 0x400>;
	};
