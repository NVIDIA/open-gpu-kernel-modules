QCOM Top Control and Status Register

Qualcomm devices have a set of registers that provide various control and status
functions for their peripherals.  This node is intended to allow access to these
registers via syscon.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should contain:
		"qcom,tcsr-ipq8064", "syscon" for IPQ8064
		"qcom,tcsr-apq8064", "syscon" for APQ8064
		"qcom,tcsr-msm8660", "syscon" for MSM8660
		"qcom,tcsr-msm8960", "syscon" for MSM8960
		"qcom,tcsr-msm8974", "syscon" for MSM8974
		"qcom,tcsr-apq8084", "syscon" for APQ8084
		"qcom,tcsr-msm8916", "syscon" for MSM8916
- reg: Address range for TCSR registers

Example:
	tcsr: syscon@1a400000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-msm8960", "syscon";
		reg = <0x1a400000 0x100>;
	};
