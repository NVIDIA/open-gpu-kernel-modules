description: |
  BD71815AGW is a single-chip power management ICs for battery-powered
  portable devices. It integrates 5 buck converters, 8 LDOs, a boost driver
  for LED and a 500 mA single-cell linear charger. Also included is a Coulomb
  counter, a real-time clock (RTC), and a 32.768 kHz clock gate and two GPOs.

    description: |
      BD71827 and BD71828 have SAR ADC for measuring charging currents.
      External sense resistor (RSENSE in data sheet) should be used. If
      something other but 30MOhm resistor is used the resistance value
      should be given here in Ohms.
    default: 30000000

  gpio-reserved-ranges:
    description: |
      Usage of BD71828 GPIO pins can be changed via OTP. This property can be
      used to mark the pins which should not be configured for GPIO. Please see
      the ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

  rohm,enable-hidden-gpo:
    description: |
      The BD71815 has undocumented GPO at pin E5. Pin is marked as GND at the
      data-sheet as it's location in the middle of GND pins makes it hard to
      use on PCB. If your board has managed to use this pin you can enable the
      second GPO by defining this property. Dont enable this if you are unsure
      about how the E5 pin is connected on your board.
