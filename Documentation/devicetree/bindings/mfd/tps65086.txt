* TPS65086 Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "ti,tps65086".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2.
			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
			    The second cell is the flags, encoded as trigger
			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
 - gpio-controller      : Marks the device node as a GPIO Controller.
 - #gpio-cells          : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
                            the second cell is used to specify flags.
                            See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
 - regulators:          : List of child nodes that specify the regulator
                            initialization data. Child nodes must be named
                            after their hardware counterparts: buck[1-6],
                            ldoa[1-3], swa1, swb[1-2], and vtt. Each child
                            node is defined using the standard binding for
                            regulators and the optional regulator properties
                            defined below.

Optional regulator properties:
 - ti,regulator-step-size-25mv	: This is applicable for buck[1-6], set this
				    if the regulator is factory set with a 25mv
				    step voltage mapping.
 - ti,regulator-decay		: This is applicable for buck[1-6], set this if
				    the output needs to decay, default is for
				    the output to slew down.

Example:

	pmic: tps65086@5e {
		compatible = "ti,tps65086";
		reg = <0x5e>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;

		regulators {
			buck1 {
				regulator-name = "vcc1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1600000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1600000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				ti,regulator-decay;
				ti,regulator-step-size-25mv;
			};
		};
	};
