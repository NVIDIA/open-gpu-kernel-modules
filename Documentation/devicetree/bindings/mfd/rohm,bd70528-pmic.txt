* ROHM BD70528 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD70528MWV is an ultra-low quiescent current general purpose, single-chip,
power management IC for battery-powered portable devices. The IC
integrates 3 ultra-low current consumption buck converters, 3 LDOs and 2
LED Drivers. Also included are 4 GPIOs, a real-time clock (RTC), a 32kHz
clock gate, high-accuracy VREF for use with an external ADC, flexible
dual-input power path, 10 bit SAR ADC for battery temperature monitor and
1S battery charger with scalable charge currents.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd70528"
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: To indicate BD70528 acts as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: Should be 2. Usage is compliant to the 2 cells
			  variant of ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
 - gpio-controller	: To indicate BD70528 acts as a GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells		: Should be 2. The first cell is the pin number and
			  the second cell is used to specify flags. See
			  ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
 - #clock-cells		: Should be 0.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators.
			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd70528-regulator.txt

Optional properties:
 - clock-output-names	: Should contain name for output clock.
