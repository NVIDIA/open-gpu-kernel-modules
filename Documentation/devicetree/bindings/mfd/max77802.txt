Maxim MAX77802 multi-function device

The Maxim MAX77802 is a Power Management IC (PMIC) that contains 10 high
efficiency Buck regulators, 32 Low-DropOut (LDO) regulators used to power
up application processors and peripherals, a 2-channel 32kHz clock outputs,
a Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and a I2C interface to program the individual
regulators, clocks outputs and the RTC.

Bindings for the built-in 32k clock generator block and
regulators are defined in ../clk/maxim,max77802.txt and
../regulator/max77802.txt respectively.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Must be "maxim,max77802"
- reg			: Specifies the I2C slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts		: I2C device IRQ line connected to the main SoC.

Example:

	max77802: pmic@9 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77802";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <26 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		reg = <0x09>;
	};
