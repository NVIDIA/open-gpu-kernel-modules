* Device tree bindings for Aspeed SoC Display Controller (GFX)

The Aspeed SoC Display Controller primarily does as its name suggests, but also
participates in pinmux requests on the g5 SoCs. It is therefore considered a
syscon device.

Required properties:
- compatible:		"aspeed,ast2500-gfx", "syscon"
- reg:			contains offset/length value of the GFX memory
			region.

Example:

gfx: display@1e6e6000 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-gfx", "syscon";
	reg = <0x1e6e6000 0x1000>;
};
