  sbs,disable-charger-broadcasts:
    description:
      SBS batteries by default send broadcast messages to SBS compliant chargers to
      configure max. charge current/voltage. If your hardware does not have an SBS
      compliant charger it should be disabled via this property to avoid blocking
      the bus. Also some SBS battery fuel gauges are known to have a buggy multi-
      master implementation.
