title: TWL4030 BCI (Battery Charger Interface)

description: |
  The battery charger needs to interact with the USB phy in order to know when
  charging is permissible, and when there is a connection or disconnection.

  The choice of phy cannot be configured at a hardware level, so there is no
  value in explicit configuration in device-tree. Rather if there is a sibling
  of the BCI node which is compatible with "ti,twl4030-usb", then that is used
  to determine when and how use USB power for charging.
