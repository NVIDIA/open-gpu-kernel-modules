    description: |
      Regulator that is used to control the VBUS voltage direction for
      either USB host mode or for charging on the OTG port

  ti,system-minimum-microvolt:
    description: |
      when power is connected and the battery is below minimum system voltage,
      the system will be regulated above this setting.

  omit-battery-class:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If this property is set, the operating system does not try to create a
      battery device.

  monitored-battery:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle
    description: |
      phandle to a "simple-battery" compatible node.

      This property must be a phandle to a node using the format described
      in battery.yaml, with the following properties being required:
      - precharge-current-microamp: maximum charge current during precharge phase
                                    (typically 20% of battery capacity).
      - charge-term-current-microamp: a charge cycle terminates when the battery voltage is
                                      above recharge threshold, and the current is below this
                                      setting (typically 10% of battery capacity).

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - interrupts
