  maxim,rsns-microohm:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Resistance of rsns resistor in micro Ohms (datasheet-recommended value is 10000).
      Defining this property enables current-sense functionality.

  maxim,cold-temp:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Temperature threshold to report battery as cold (in tenths of degree Celsius).
      Default is not to report cold events.

  maxim,over-heat-temp:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Temperature threshold to report battery as over heated (in tenths of degree Celsius).
      Default is not to report over heating events.

  maxim,dead-volt:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Voltage threshold to report battery as dead (in mV).
      Default is not to report dead battery events.

  maxim,over-volt:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Voltage threshold to report battery as over voltage (in mV).
      Default is not to report over-voltage events.
