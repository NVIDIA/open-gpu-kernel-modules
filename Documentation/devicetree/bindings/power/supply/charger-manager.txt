charger-manager bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : "charger-manager"
 - <>-supply : for regulator consumer, named according to cm-regulator-name
 - cm-chargers : name of chargers
 - cm-fuel-gauge : name of battery fuel gauge
 - subnode <regulator> :
	- cm-regulator-name : name of charger regulator
	- subnode <cable> :
		- cm-cable-name : name of charger cable - one of USB, USB-HOST,
			SDP, DCP, CDP, ACA, FAST-CHARGER, SLOW-CHARGER, WPT,
			PD, DOCK, JIG, or MECHANICAL
		- cm-cable-extcon : name of extcon dev
(optional)	- cm-cable-min : minimum current of cable
(optional)	- cm-cable-max : maximum current of cable

Optional properties :
 - cm-name : charger manager's name (default : "battery")
 - cm-poll-mode : polling mode - 0 for disabled, 1 for always, 2 for when
	external power is connected, or 3 for when charging.  If not present,
	then polling is disabled
 - cm-poll-interval : polling interval (in ms)
 - cm-battery-stat : battery status - 0 for battery always present, 1 for no
	battery, 2 to check presence via fuel gauge, or 3 to check presence
	via charger
 - cm-fullbatt-vchkdrop-volt : voltage drop (in uV) before restarting charging
 - cm-fullbatt-voltage : voltage (in uV) of full battery
 - cm-fullbatt-soc : state of charge to consider as full battery
 - cm-fullbatt-capacity : capcity (in uAh) to consider as full battery
 - cm-thermal-zone : name of external thermometer's thermal zone
 - cm-battery-* : threshold battery temperature for charging
	-cold : critical cold temperature of battery for charging
	-cold-in-minus : flag that cold temperature is in minus degrees
	-hot : critical hot temperature of battery for charging
	-temp-diff : temperature difference to allow recharging
 - cm-dis/charging-max = limits of charging duration

Deprecated properties:
 - cm-num-chargers
 - cm-fullbatt-vchkdrop-ms
