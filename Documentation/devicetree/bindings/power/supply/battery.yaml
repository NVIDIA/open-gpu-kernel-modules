title: Battery Characteristics

description: |
  The devicetree battery node provides static battery characteristics.
  In smart batteries, these are typically stored in non-volatile memory
  on a fuel gauge chip. The battery node should be used where there is
  no appropriate non-volatile memory, or it is unprogrammed/incorrect.

  Upstream dts files should not include battery nodes, unless the battery
  represented cannot easily be replaced in the system by one of a
  different type. This prevents unpredictable, potentially harmful,
  behavior should a replacement that changes the battery type occur
  without a corresponding update to the dtb.

  Battery properties are named, where possible, for the corresponding elements
  in enum power_supply_property, defined in include/linux/power_supply.h

  Batteries must be referenced by chargers and/or fuel-gauges using a phandle.
  The phandle's property should be named "monitored-battery".
