* ARC HS Performance Counters

The ARC HS can be configured with a pipeline performance monitor for counting
CPU and cache events like cache misses and hits. Like conventional PCT there
are 100+ hardware conditions dynamically mapped to up to 32 counters.
It also supports overflow interrupts.

Required properties:

- compatible : should contain
	"snps,archs-pct"

Example:

pmu {
        compatible = "snps,archs-pct";
};
