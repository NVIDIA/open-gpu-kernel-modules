* OHCI controller, NXP ohci-nxp variant

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "nxp,ohci-nxp"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: The OHCI interrupt
- transceiver: phandle of the associated ISP1301 device - this is necessary for
               the UDC controller for connecting to the USB physical layer

Example (LPC32xx):

	isp1301: usb-transceiver@2c {
		compatible = "nxp,isp1301";
		reg = <0x2c>;
	};

	ohci@31020000 {
		compatible = "nxp,ohci-nxp";
		reg = <0x31020000 0x300>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
		interrupts = <0x3b 0>;
		transceiver = <&isp1301>;
	};
