Broadcom USB Device Controller (BDC)
====================================

Required properties:

- compatible: must be one of:
                "brcm,bdc-udc-v2"
                "brcm,bdc"
- reg: the base register address and length
- interrupts: the interrupt line for this controller

Optional properties:

On Broadcom STB platforms, these properties are required:

- phys: phandle to one or two USB PHY blocks
        NOTE: Some SoC's have a single phy and some have
        USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 phys
- clocks: phandle to the functional clock of this block

Example:

        bdc@f0b02000 {
                compatible = "brcm,bdc-udc-v2";
                reg = <0xf0b02000 0xfc4>;
                interrupts = <0x0 0x60 0x0>;
                phys = <&usbphy_0 0x0>;
                clocks = <&sw_usbd>;
        };
