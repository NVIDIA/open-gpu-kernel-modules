      Tells USB controllers that we want to configure the core to support a
      UTMI+ PHY with an 8- or 16-bit interface if UTMI+ is selected, UTMI+ low
      pin interface if ULPI is specified, Serial core/PHY interconnect if
      serial is specified and High-Speed Inter-Chip feature if HSIC is
      selected. In case this isn't passed via DT, USB controllers should
      default to HW capability.
