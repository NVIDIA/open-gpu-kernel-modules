ST USB OHCI controller

Required properties:

 - compatible		: must be "st,st-ohci-300x"
 - reg			: physical base addresses of the controller and length of memory mapped
			  region
 - interrupts		: one OHCI controller interrupt should be described here
 - clocks		: phandle list of usb clocks
 - clock-names		: should be "ic" for interconnect clock and "clk48"
See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

 - phys			: phandle for the PHY device
 - phy-names		: should be "usb"

 - resets		: phandle to the powerdown and reset controller for the USB IP
 - reset-names		: should be "power" and "softreset".
See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/st,sti-powerdown.txt
See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

Example:

	ohci0: usb@fe1ffc00 {
		compatible = "st,st-ohci-300x";
		reg = <0xfe1ffc00 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 149 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		clocks = <&clk_s_a1_ls 0>,
			 <&clockgen_b0 0>;
		clock-names = "ic", "clk48";
		phys = <&usb2_phy>;
		phy-names = "usb";

		resets = <&powerdown STIH416_USB0_POWERDOWN>,
			 <&softreset STIH416_USB0_SOFTRESET>;
		reset-names = "power", "softreset";
	};
