* Samsung Exynos5410 Clock Controller

The Exynos5410 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Exynos5410 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "samsung,exynos5410-clock"

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

- clocks: should contain an entry specifying the root clock from external
  oscillator supplied through XXTI or XusbXTI pin.  This clock should be
  defined using standard clock bindings with "fin_pll" clock-output-name.
  That clock is being passed internally to the 9 PLLs.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos5410.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	fin_pll: xxti {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		clock-output-names = "fin_pll";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
	};

	clock: clock-controller@10010000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5410-clock";
		reg = <0x10010000 0x30000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&fin_pll>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@12c20000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-uart";
		reg = <0x12C00000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 51 0>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART0>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_UART0>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};
