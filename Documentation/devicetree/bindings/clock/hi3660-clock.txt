* Hisilicon Hi3660 Clock Controller

The Hi3660 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Hi3660 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: the compatible should be one of the following strings to
	indicate the clock controller functionality.

	- "hisilicon,hi3660-crgctrl"
	- "hisilicon,hi3660-pctrl"
	- "hisilicon,hi3660-pmuctrl"
	- "hisilicon,hi3660-sctrl"
	- "hisilicon,hi3660-iomcu"
	- "hisilicon,hi3660-stub-clk"

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Optional Properties:

- mboxes: Phandle to the mailbox for sending message to MCU.
            (See: ../mailbox/hisilicon,hi3660-mailbox.txt for more info)

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi3660-clock.h>.

Examples:
	crg_ctrl: clock-controller@fff35000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3660-crgctrl", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0 0xfff35000 0x0 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	uart0: serial@fdf02000 {
		compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x0 0xfdf02000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 74 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&crg_ctrl HI3660_CLK_MUX_UART0>,
			 <&crg_ctrl HI3660_PCLK>;
		clock-names = "uartclk", "apb_pclk";
	};
