Clock bindings for ST-Ericsson ABx500 clocks

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain the following:
  "stericsson,ab8500-clk"
- #clock-cells should be <1>

The ABx500 clocks need to be placed as a subnode of an AB8500
device node, see mfd/ab8500.txt

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/ste-ab8500.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example:

clock-controller {
	compatible = "stericsson,ab8500-clk";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};
