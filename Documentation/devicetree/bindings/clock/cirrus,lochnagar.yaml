title: Cirrus Logic Lochnagar Audio Development Board

maintainers:

description: |
  Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus Logic
  Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of most Cirrus
  Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing connection of various
  application processor systems to provide a full evaluation platform.
  Audio system topology, clocking and power can all be controlled through
  the Lochnagar, allowing the device under test to be used in a variety of
  possible use cases.

  This binding document describes the binding for the clock portion of the
  driver.

  Also see these documents for generic binding information:
    [1] Clock : ../clock/clock-bindings.txt

  And these for relevant defines:
    [2] include/dt-bindings/clock/lochnagar.h

  This binding must be part of the Lochnagar MFD binding:
    [3] ../mfd/cirrus,lochnagar.yaml
