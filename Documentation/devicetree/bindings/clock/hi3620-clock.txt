* Hisilicon Hi3620 Clock Controller

The Hi3620 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Hi3620 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hi3620-clock" - controller compatible with Hi3620 SoC.
  - "hisilicon,hi3620-mmc-clock" - controller specific for Hi3620 mmc.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi3620-clock.h>.
