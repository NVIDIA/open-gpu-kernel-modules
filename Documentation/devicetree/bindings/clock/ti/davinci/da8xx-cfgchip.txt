Binding for TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX CFGCHIP clocks

TI DA8XX/OMAP-L13X/AM17XX/AM18XX SoCs contain a general purpose set of
registers call CFGCHIPn. Some of these registers function as clock
gates. This document describes the bindings for those clocks.

All of the clock nodes described below must be child nodes of a CFGCHIP node
(compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip").

USB PHY clocks
--------------
Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da830-usb-phy-clocks".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.
- clocks: phandles to the parent clocks corresponding to clock-names
- clock-names: shall be "fck", "usb_refclkin", "auxclk"

This node provides two clocks. The clock at index 0 is the USB 2.0 PHY 48MHz
clock and the clock at index 1 is the USB 1.1 PHY 48MHz clock.

eHRPWM Time Base Clock (TBCLK)
------------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da830-tbclksync".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandle to the parent clock
- clock-names: shall be "fck"

PLL DIV4.5 divider
------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da830-div4p5ena".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandle to the parent clock
- clock-names: shall be "pll0_pllout"

EMIFA clock source (ASYNC1)
---------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da850-async1-clksrc".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandles to the parent clocks corresponding to clock-names
- clock-names: shall be "pll0_sysclk3", "div4.5"

ASYNC3 clock source
-------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,da850-async3-clksrc".
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks: phandles to the parent clocks corresponding to clock-names
- clock-names: shall be "pll0_sysclk2", "pll1_sysclk2"

Examples:

	cfgchip: syscon@1417c {
		compatible = "ti,da830-cfgchip", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1417c 0x14>;

		usb_phy_clk: usb-phy-clocks {
			compatible = "ti,da830-usb-phy-clocks";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&psc1 1>, <&usb_refclkin>, <&pll0_auxclk>;
			clock-names = "fck", "usb_refclkin", "auxclk";
		};
		ehrpwm_tbclk: ehrpwm_tbclk {
			compatible = "ti,da830-tbclksync";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&psc1 17>;
			clock-names = "fck";
		};
		div4p5_clk: div4.5 {
			compatible = "ti,da830-div4p5ena";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&pll0_pllout>;
			clock-names = "pll0_pllout";
		};
		async1_clk: async1 {
			compatible = "ti,da850-async1-clksrc";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&pll0_sysclk 3>, <&div4p5_clk>;
			clock-names = "pll0_sysclk3", "div4.5";
		};
		async3_clk: async3 {
			compatible = "ti,da850-async3-clksrc";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&pll0_sysclk 2>, <&pll1_sysclk 2>;
			clock-names = "pll0_sysclk2", "pll1_sysclk2";
		};
	};
