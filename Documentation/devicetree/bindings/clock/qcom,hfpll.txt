High-Frequency PLL (HFPLL)

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>:
		shall contain only one of the following. The generic
		compatible "qcom,hfpll" should be also included.

                        "qcom,hfpll-ipq8064", "qcom,hfpll"
                        "qcom,hfpll-apq8064", "qcom,hfpll"
                        "qcom,hfpll-msm8974", "qcom,hfpll"
                        "qcom,hfpll-msm8960", "qcom,hfpll"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: address and size of HPLL registers. An optional second
		    element specifies the address and size of the alias
		    register region.

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to the xo clock.

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "xo".

- clock-output-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Name of the PLL. Typically hfpllX where X is a CPU number
		    starting at 0. Otherwise hfpll_Y where Y is more specific
		    such as "l2".

Example:

1) An HFPLL for the L2 cache.

	clock-controller@f9016000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hfpll-ipq8064", "qcom,hfpll";
		reg = <0xf9016000 0x30>;
		clocks = <&xo_board>;
		clock-names = "xo";
		clock-output-names = "hfpll_l2";
	};

2) An HFPLL for CPU0. This HFPLL has the alias register region.

	clock-controller@f908a000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hfpll-ipq8064", "qcom,hfpll";
		reg = <0xf908a000 0x30>, <0xf900a000 0x30>;
		clocks = <&xo_board>;
		clock-names = "xo";
		clock-output-names = "hfpll0";
	};
