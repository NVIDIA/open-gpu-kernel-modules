Microchip PIC32 Clock Controller Binding
----------------------------------------
Microchip clock controller is consists of few oscillators, PLL, multiplexer
and few divider modules.

This binding uses common clock bindings.
[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "microchip,pic32mzda-clk".
- reg: shall contain base address and length of clock registers.
- #clock-cells: shall be 1.

Optional properties:
- microchip,pic32mzda-sosc: shall be added only if platform has
  secondary oscillator connected.

Example:
	rootclk: clock-controller@1f801200 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-clk";
		reg = <0x1f801200 0x200>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		/* optional */
		microchip,pic32mzda-sosc;
	};


The clock consumer shall specify the desired clock-output of the clock
controller (as defined in [2]) by specifying output-id in its "clock"
phandle cell.
[2] include/dt-bindings/clock/microchip,pic32-clock.h

For example for UART2:
uart2: serial@2 {
	compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-uart";
	reg = <>;
	interrupts = <>;
	clocks = <&rootclk PB2CLK>;
};
