Texas Instruments TI-SCI Clocks
===============================

All clocks on Texas Instruments' SoCs that contain a System Controller,
are only controlled by this entity. Communication between a host processor
running an OS and the System Controller happens through a protocol known
as TI-SCI[1]. This clock implementation plugs into the common clock
framework and makes use of the TI-SCI protocol on clock API requests.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "ti,k2g-sci-clk"
- #clock-cells: Shall be 2.
  In clock consumers, this cell represents the device ID and clock ID
  exposed by the PM firmware. The list of valid values for the device IDs
  and clocks IDs for 66AK2G SoC are documented at
  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TISCI#66AK2G02_Data

Examples:
--------

pmmc: pmmc {
	compatible = "ti,k2g-sci";

	k2g_clks: clocks {
		compatible = "ti,k2g-sci-clk";
		#clock-cells = <2>;
	};
};

uart0: serial@2530c00 {
	compatible = "ns16550a";
	clocks = <&k2g_clks 0x2c 0>;
};
