Device Tree Clock bindings for cpu clock of Marvell EBU platforms

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-xp-cpu-clock" - cpu clocks for Armada XP
	"marvell,mv98dx3236-cpu-clock" - cpu clocks for 98DX3236 SoC
- reg : Address and length of the clock complex register set, followed
        by address and length of the PMU DFS registers
- #clock-cells : should be set to 1.
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock phandle for the clock.

cpuclk: clock-complex@d0018700 {
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "marvell,armada-xp-cpu-clock";
	reg = <0xd0018700 0xA0>, <0x1c054 0x10>;
	clocks = <&coreclk 1>;
}

cpu@0 {
	compatible = "marvell,sheeva-v7";
	reg = <0>;
	clocks = <&cpuclk 0>;
};
