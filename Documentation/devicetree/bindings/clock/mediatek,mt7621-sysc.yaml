title: MT7621 Clock Device Tree Bindings

description: |
  The MT7621 has a PLL controller from where the cpu clock is provided
  as well as derived clocks for the bus and the peripherals. It also
  can gate SoC device clocks.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All these identifiers could be found in:
  [1]: <include/dt-bindings/clock/mt7621-clk.h>.

  The clocks are provided inside a system controller node.
