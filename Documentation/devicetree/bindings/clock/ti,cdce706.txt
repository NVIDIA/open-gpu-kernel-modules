Bindings for Texas Instruments CDCE706 programmable 3-PLL clock
synthesizer/multiplier/divider.

Reference: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cdce706.pdf

I2C device node required properties:
- compatible: shall be "ti,cdce706".
- reg: i2c device address, shall be in range [0x68...0x6b].
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1.
- clocks: from common clock binding; list of parent clock
  handles, shall be reference clock(s) connected to CLK_IN0
  and CLK_IN1 pins.
- clock-names: shall be clk_in0 and/or clk_in1. Use clk_in0
  in case of crystal oscillator or differential signal input
  configuration. Use clk_in0 and clk_in1 in case of independent
  single-ended LVCMOS inputs configuration.

Example:

	clocks {
		clk54: clk54 {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			clock-frequency = <54000000>;
		};
	};
	...
	i2c0: i2c-master@d090000 {
		...
		cdce706: clock-synth@69 {
			compatible = "ti,cdce706";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			reg = <0x69>;
			clocks = <&clk54>;
			clock-names = "clk_in0";
		};
	};
	...
	simple-audio-card,codec {
		...
		clocks = <&cdce706 4>;
	};
