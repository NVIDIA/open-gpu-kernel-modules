* Samsung Exynos5420 Clock Controller

The Exynos5420 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Exynos5420 SoC and for the Exynos5800 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "samsung,exynos5420-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos5420 SoC.
  - "samsung,exynos5800-clock" - controller compatible with Exynos5800 SoC.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos5420.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example 1: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock: clock-controller@10010000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5420-clock";
		reg = <0x10010000 0x30000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

Example 2: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
	   controller. Refer to the standard clock bindings for information
	   about 'clocks' and 'clock-names' property.

	serial@13820000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-uart";
		reg = <0x13820000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 54 0>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_UART2>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_UART2>;
		clock-names = "uart", "clk_uart_baud0";
	};
