* Clock bindings for Marvell PXA chips

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,pxa-clocks"
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell (see include/.../pxa-clock.h).

Examples:

pxa2xx_clks: pxa2xx_clks@41300004 {
        compatible = "marvell,pxa-clocks";
        #clock-cells = <1>;
};
