* Clock bindings for Freescale Vybrid VF610 SOC

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,vf610-ccm"
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

Optional properties:
- clocks: list of clock identifiers which are external input clocks to the
	given clock controller. Please refer the next section to find
	the input clocks for a given controller.
- clock-names: list of names of clocks which are exteral input clocks to the
	given clock controller.

Input clocks for top clock controller:
	- sxosc (external crystal oscillator 32KHz, recommended)
	- fxosc (external crystal oscillator 24MHz, recommended)
	- audio_ext
	- enet_ext

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/vf610-clock.h
for the full list of VF610 clock IDs.

Examples:

clks: ccm@4006b000 {
	compatible = "fsl,vf610-ccm";
	reg = <0x4006b000 0x1000>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&sxosc>, <&fxosc>;
	clock-names = "sxosc", "fxosc";
};

uart1: serial@40028000 {
	compatible = "fsl,vf610-uart";
	reg = <0x40028000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 62 0x04>;
	clocks = <&clks VF610_CLK_UART1>;
	clock-names = "ipg";
};
