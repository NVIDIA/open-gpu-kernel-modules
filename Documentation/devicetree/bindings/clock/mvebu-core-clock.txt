* Core Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU SoCs

Marvell MVEBU SoCs usually allow to determine core clock frequencies by
reading the Sample-At-Reset (SAR) register. The core clock consumer should
specify the desired clock by having the clock ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada 370/XP:
 0 = tclk    (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk  (CPU clock)
 2 = nbclk   (L2 Cache clock)
 3 = hclk    (DRAM control clock)
 4 = dramclk (DDR clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada 375:
 0 = tclk    (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk  (CPU clock)
 2 = l2clk   (L2 Cache clock)
 3 = ddrclk  (DDR clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada 380/385:
 0 = tclk    (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk  (CPU clock)
 2 = l2clk   (L2 Cache clock)
 3 = ddrclk  (DDR clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada 39x:
 0 = tclk    (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk  (CPU clock)
 2 = nbclk   (Coherent Fabric clock)
 3 = hclk    (SDRAM Controller Internal Clock)
 4 = dclk    (SDRAM Interface Clock)
 5 = refclk  (Reference Clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on 98dx3236:
 0 = tclk    (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk  (CPU clock)
 2 = ddrclk   (DDR clock)
 3 = mpll    (MPLL Clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Kirkwood and Dove:
 0 = tclk   (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk (CPU0 clock)
 2 = l2clk  (L2 Cache clock derived from CPU0 clock)
 3 = ddrclk (DDR controller clock derived from CPU0 clock)

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Orion5x:
 0 = tclk   (Internal Bus clock)
 1 = cpuclk (CPU0 clock)
 2 = ddrclk (DDR controller clock derived from CPU0 clock)

	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

spi0: spi@10600 {
	compatible = "marvell,orion-spi";
	/* ... */
	/* get tclk from core clock provider */
	clocks = <&core_clk 0>;
};
