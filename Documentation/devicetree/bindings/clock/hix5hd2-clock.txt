* Hisilicon Hix5hd2 Clock Controller

The hix5hd2 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the hix5hd2 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "hisilicon,hix5hd2-clock"
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hix5hd2-clock.h>.

Examples:
	clock: clock@f8a22000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hix5hd2-clock";
		reg = <0xf8a22000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	uart0: uart@f8b00000 {
		compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0xf8b00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 49 4>;
		clocks = <&clock HIX5HD2_FIXED_83M>;
		clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	};
