* Clock bindings for the Cirrus Logic CLPS711X CPUs

Required properties:
- compatible       : Shall contain "cirrus,ep7209-clk".
- reg              : Address of the internal register set.
- startup-frequency: Factory set CPU startup frequency in HZ.
- #clock-cells     : Should be <1>.

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell. See include/dt-bindings/clock/clps711x-clock.h
for the full list of CLPS711X clock IDs.

Example:
	clks: clks@80000000 {
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "cirrus,ep7312-clk", "cirrus,ep7209-clk";
		reg = <0x80000000 0xc000>;
		startup-frequency = <73728000>;
	};
