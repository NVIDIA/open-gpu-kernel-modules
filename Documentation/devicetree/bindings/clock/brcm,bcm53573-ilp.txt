Broadcom BCM53573 ILP clock
===========================

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

This binding is used for ILP clock (sometimes referred as "slow clock")
on Broadcom BCM53573 devices using Cortex-A7 CPU.

ILP's rate has to be calculated on runtime and it depends on ALP clock
which has to be referenced.

This clock is part of PMU (Power Management Unit), a Broadcom's device
handing power-related aspects. Its node must be sub-node of the PMU
device.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm53573-ilp"
- clocks: has to reference an ALP clock
- #clock-cells: should be <0>
- clock-output-names: from common clock bindings, should contain clock
		      name

Example:

pmu@18012000 {
	compatible = "simple-mfd", "syscon";
	reg = <0x18012000 0x00001000>;

	ilp {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm53573-ilp";
		clocks = <&alp>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "ilp";
	};
};
