Broadcom BCM2835 I2C controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of:
	"brcm,bcm2711-i2c"
	"brcm,bcm2835-i2c"
- reg: Should contain register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt.
- clocks : The clock feeding the I2C controller.

Recommended properties:
- clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Example:

i2c@7e205000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-i2c";
	reg = <0x7e205000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <2 21>;
	clocks = <&clk_i2c>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
};
