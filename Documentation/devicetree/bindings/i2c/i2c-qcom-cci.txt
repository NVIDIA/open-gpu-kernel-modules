Qualcomm Camera Control Interface (CCI) I2C controller

PROPERTIES:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		"qcom,msm8916-cci"
		"qcom,msm8996-cci"
		"qcom,sdm845-cci"

- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address CCI I2C controller and length of memory
		    mapped region.

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: specifies the CCI I2C interrupt. The format of the
		    specifier is defined by the binding document describing
		    the node's interrupt parent.

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: a list of phandle, should contain an entry for each
		    entries in clock-names.

- clock-names
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: a list of clock names, must include "cci" clock.

- power-domains
	Usage: required for "qcom,msm8996-cci"
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:

SUBNODES:

The CCI provides I2C masters for one (msm8916) or two i2c busses (msm8996 and
sdm845), described as subdevices named "i2c-bus@0" and "i2c-bus@1".

PROPERTIES:

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Index of the CCI bus/master

- clock-frequency:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz, defaults to 100
		    kHz if omitted.

Example:

	cci@a0c000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-cci";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xa0c000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 295 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&mmcc MMSS_MMAGIC_AHB_CLK>,
			 <&mmcc CAMSS_TOP_AHB_CLK>,
			 <&mmcc CAMSS_CCI_AHB_CLK>,
			 <&mmcc CAMSS_CCI_CLK>,
			 <&mmcc CAMSS_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "mmss_mmagic_ahb",
			      "camss_top_ahb",
			      "cci_ahb",
			      "cci",
			      "camss_ahb";

		i2c-bus@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <400000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
		};

		i2c-bus@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			clock-frequency = <400000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
