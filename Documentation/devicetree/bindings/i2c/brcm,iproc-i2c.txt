Broadcom iProc I2C controller

Required properties:

- compatible:
    Must be "brcm,iproc-i2c" or "brcm,iproc-nic-i2c"

- reg:
    Define the base and range of the I/O address space that contain the iProc
    I2C controller registers

- clock-frequency:
    This is the I2C bus clock. Need to be either 100000 or 400000

- #address-cells:
    Always 1 (for I2C addresses)

- #size-cells:
    Always 0

Optional properties:

- interrupts:
    Should contain the I2C interrupt. For certain revisions of the I2C
    controller, I2C interrupt is unwired to the interrupt controller. In such
    case, this property should be left unspecified, and driver will fall back
    to polling mode

- brcm,ape-hsls-addr-mask:
    Required for "brcm,iproc-nic-i2c". Host view of address mask into the
    'APE' co-processor. Value must be unsigned, 32-bit

Example:
	i2c0: i2c@18008000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-i2c";
		reg = <0x18008000 0x100>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 85 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;

		codec: wm8750@1a {
			compatible = "wlf,wm8750";
			reg = <0x1a>;
		};
	};
