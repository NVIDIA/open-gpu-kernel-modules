	When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first followed
	by the generic version.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: interrupt specifier.

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. The absence of this
  property indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
- clocks: clock specifier.
- dmas: Must contain a list of two references to DMA specifiers, one for
  transmission, and one for reception.
- dma-names: Must contain a list of two DMA names, "tx" and "rx".
