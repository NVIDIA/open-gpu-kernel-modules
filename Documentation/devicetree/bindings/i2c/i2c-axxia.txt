LSI Axxia I2C

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be "lsi,api2c"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : the interrupt specifier
- #address-cells : Must be <1>;
- #size-cells : Must be <0>;
- clock-names : Must contain "i2c".
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each name in clock-names. See the common
  clock bindings.

Optional properties :
- clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified,
  the default 100 kHz frequency will be used. As only Normal and Fast modes
  are supported, possible values are 100000 and 400000.

Example :

i2c@2010084000 {
	compatible = "lsi,api2c";
	device_type = "i2c";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x20 0x10084000 0x00 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 19 4>;
	clocks = <&clk_per>;
	clock-names = "i2c";
	clock-frequency = <400000>;
};
