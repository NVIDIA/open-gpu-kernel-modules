Generic devicetree bindings for onewire (w1) busses
===================================================

Onewire busses are described through nodes of their master bus controller.
Slave devices are listed as sub-nodes of such master devices. For now, only
one slave is allowed per bus master.


Example:

	charger: charger {
		compatible = "gpio-charger";
		charger-type = "mains";
		gpios = <&gpio 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};

	onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio 100 0>, <&gpio 101 0>;

		battery {
			compatible = "maxim,ds2760";
			power-supplies = <&charger>;
		};
	};
