* H1 Secure Microcontroller with Cr50 Firmware on SPI Bus.

H1 Secure Microcontroller running Cr50 firmware provides several
functions, including TPM-like functionality. It communicates over
SPI using the FIFO protocol described in the PTP Spec, section 6.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "google,cr50".
- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI frequency.

Example:

&spi0 {
	tpm@0 {
		compatible = "google,cr50";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <800000>;
	};
};
