* Device Tree Bindings for I2C based Trusted Platform Module(TPM)

Required properties:

- compatible     : 'manufacturer,model', eg. nuvoton,npct650
- label          : human readable string describing the device, eg. "tpm"
- linux,sml-base : 64-bit base address of the reserved memory allocated for
                   the firmware event log
- linux,sml-size : size of the memory allocated for the firmware event log

Optional properties:

- powered-while-suspended: present when the TPM is left powered on between
                           suspend and resume (makes the suspend/resume
                           callbacks do nothing).

Example (for OpenPower Systems with Nuvoton TPM 2.0 on I2C)
----------------------------------------------------------

tpm@57 {
	reg = <0x57>;
	label = "tpm";
	compatible = "nuvoton,npct650", "nuvoton,npct601";
	linux,sml-base = <0x7f 0xfd450000>;
	linux,sml-size = <0x10000>;
};
