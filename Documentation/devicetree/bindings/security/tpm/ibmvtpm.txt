* Device Tree Bindings for IBM Virtual Trusted Platform Module(vtpm)

Required properties:

- compatible            : property name that conveys the platform architecture
                          identifiers, as 'IBM,vtpm'
- device_type           : specifies type of virtual device
- interrupts            : property specifying the interrupt source number and
                          sense code associated with this virtual I/O Adapters
- ibm,my-drc-index      : integer index for the connector between the device
                          and its parent - present only if Dynamic
                          Reconfiguration(DR) Connector is enabled
- ibm,#dma-address-cells: specifies the number of cells that are used to
                          encode the physical address field of dma-window
                          properties
- ibm,#dma-size-cells   : specifies the number of cells that are used to
                          encode the size field of dma-window properties
- ibm,my-dma-window     : specifies DMA window associated with this virtual
                          IOA
- ibm,loc-code          : specifies the unique and persistent location code
                          associated with this virtual I/O Adapters
- linux,sml-base        : 64-bit base address of the reserved memory allocated
                          for the firmware event log
- linux,sml-size        : size of the memory allocated for the firmware event log
