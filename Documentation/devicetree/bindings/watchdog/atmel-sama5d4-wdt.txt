* Atmel SAMA5D4 Watchdog Timer (WDT) Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "atmel,sama5d4-wdt" or "microchip,sam9x60-wdt"
- reg: base physical address and length of memory mapped region.

Optional properties:
- timeout-sec: watchdog timeout value (in seconds).
- interrupts: interrupt number to the CPU.
- atmel,watchdog-type: should be "hardware" or "software".
	"hardware": enable watchdog fault reset. A watchdog fault triggers
		    watchdog reset.
	"software": enable watchdog fault interrupt. A watchdog fault asserts
		    watchdog interrupt.
- atmel,idle-halt: present if you want to stop the watchdog when the CPU is
		   in idle state.
	CAUTION: This property should be used with care, it actually makes the
	watchdog not counting when the CPU is in idle state, therefore the
	watchdog reset time depends on mean CPU usage and will not reset at all
	if the CPU stop working while it is in idle state, which is probably
	not what you want.
- atmel,dbg-halt: present if you want to stop the watchdog when the CPU is
		  in debug state.

Example:
	watchdog@fc068640 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d4-wdt";
		reg = <0xfc068640 0x10>;
		interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 5>;
		timeout-sec = <10>;
		atmel,watchdog-type = "hardware";
		atmel,dbg-halt;
		atmel,idle-halt;
	};
