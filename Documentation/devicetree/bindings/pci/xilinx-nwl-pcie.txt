* Xilinx NWL PCIe Root Port Bridge DT description

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "xlnx,nwl-pcie-2.11"
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports, set to <3>
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports, set to <2>
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
	interrupt source. The value must be 1.
- reg: Should contain Bridge, PCIe Controller registers location,
	configuration space, and length
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
	"breg": bridge registers
	"pcireg": PCIe controller registers
	"cfg": configuration space region
- device_type: must be "pci"
- interrupts: Should contain NWL PCIe interrupt
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
	"msi1, msi0": interrupt asserted when an MSI is received
	"intx": interrupt asserted when a legacy interrupt is received
	"misc": interrupt asserted when miscellaneous interrupt is received
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: standard PCI properties to define the
	mapping of the PCI interface to interrupt numbers.
- ranges: ranges for the PCI memory regions (I/O space region is not
	supported by hardware)
	Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more
	detailed explanation
- msi-controller: indicates that this is MSI controller node
- msi-parent:  MSI parent of the root complex itself
- legacy-interrupt-controller: Interrupt controller device node for Legacy
	interrupts
	- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
	- #interrupt-cells: should be set to 1
	- #address-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
		address. The value must be 0.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: present if DMA operations are coherent
