Amlogic Meson AXG DWC PCIE SoC controller

Amlogic Meson PCIe host controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCI core.
It shares common functions with the PCIe DesignWare core driver and
inherits common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties:
- compatible:
	should contain :
	- "amlogic,axg-pcie" for AXG SoC Family
	- "amlogic,g12a-pcie" for G12A SoC Family
	to identify the core.
- reg:
	should contain the configuration address space.
- reg-names: Must be
	- "elbi"	External local bus interface registers
	- "cfg"		Meson specific registers
	- "config"	PCIe configuration space
- reset-gpios: The GPIO to generate PCIe PERST# assert and deassert signal.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
	- "pclk"       PCIe GEN 100M PLL clock
	- "port"       PCIe_x(A or B) RC clock gate
	- "general"    PCIe Phy clock
- resets: phandle to the reset lines.
- reset-names: must contain "port" and "apb"
       - "port"        Port A or B reset
       - "apb"         Share APB reset
- phys: should contain a phandle to the PCIE phy
- phy-names: must contain "pcie"

- device_type:
	should be "pci". As specified in designware-pcie.txt
