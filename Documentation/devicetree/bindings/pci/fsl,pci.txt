* Bus Enumeration by Freescale PCI-X Agent

Typically any Freescale PCI-X bridge hardware strapped into Agent mode
is prevented from enumerating the bus. The PrPMC form-factor requires
all mezzanines to be PCI-X Agents, but one per system may still
enumerate the bus.

The property defined below will allow a PCI-X bridge to be used for bus
enumeration despite being strapped into Agent mode.

Required properties:
- fsl,pci-agent-force-enum : There is no value associated with this
  property. The property itself is treated as a boolean.

Example:

	/* PCI-X bridge known to be PrPMC Monarch */
	pci0: pci@ef008000 {
		fsl,pci-agent-force-enum;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <3>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8540-pcix", "fsl,mpc8540-pci";
		device_type = "pci";
		...
		...
	};
