HiSilicon STB PCIe host bridge DT description

The HiSilicon STB PCIe host controller is based on the DesignWare PCIe core.
It shares common functions with the DesignWare PCIe core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings:
		"hisilicon,hi3798cv200-pcie"
- reg: Should contain sysctl, rc_dbi, config registers location and length.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "control": control registers of PCIe controller;
  "rc-dbi": configuration space of PCIe controller;
  "config": configuration transaction space of PCIe controller.
- bus-range: PCI bus numbers covered.
- interrupts: MSI interrupt.
- interrupt-names: Must include "msi" entries.
- clocks: List of phandle and clock specifier pairs as listed in clock-names
  property.
- clock-name: Must include the following entries:
  "aux": auxiliary gate clock;
  "pipe": pipe gate clock;
  "sys": sys gate clock;
  "bus": bus gate clock.
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs as listed in reset-names
  property.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  "soft": soft reset;
  "sys": sys reset;
  "bus": bus reset.

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios: The gpio to generate PCIe PERST# assert and deassert signal.
- vpcie-supply: The regulator in charge of PCIe port power.
- phys: List of phandle and phy mode specifier, should be 0.
- phy-names: Must be "phy".
