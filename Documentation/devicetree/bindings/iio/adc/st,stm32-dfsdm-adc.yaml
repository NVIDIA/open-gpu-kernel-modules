description: |
  STM32 DFSDM ADC is a sigma delta analog-to-digital converter dedicated to
  interface external sigma delta modulators to STM32 micro controllers.
  It is mainly targeted for:
  - Sigma delta modulators (motor control, metering...)
  - PDM microphones (audio digital microphone)

  It features up to 8 serial digital interfaces (SPI or Manchester) and
  up to 4 filters on stm32h7 or 6 filters on stm32mp1.

  Each child node matches with a filter instance.
