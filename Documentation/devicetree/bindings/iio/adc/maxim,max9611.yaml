title: Maxim MAX9611 and similar current sense amplifiers with integrated ADCs

maintainers:
  - Jacopo Mondi <jacopo@jmondi.org>

description: |
   These devices combine a high-side current sense amplifier with a 12 bit ADC.
   They have an i2c interface.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - maxim,max9611
      - maxim,max9612

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  shunt-resistor-micro-ohms:
    description: |
      Value in micro Ohms of the shunt resistor connected between the RS+ and
      RS- inputs, across which the current is measured.  Value needed to compute
      the scaling of the measured current.

additionalProperties: false

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
