description: |
  The AD9467 and the parts similar with it, are high-speed analog-to-digital
  converters (ADCs), operating in the range of 100 to 500 mega samples
  per second (MSPS). Some parts support higher MSPS and some
  lower MSPS, suitable for the intended application of each part.

  All the parts support the register map described by Application Note AN-877
