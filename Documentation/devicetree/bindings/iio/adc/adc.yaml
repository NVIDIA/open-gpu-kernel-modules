  A few properties are defined in a common way ADC channels.

    description:
      Many ADCs have dual Muxes to allow different input pins to be routed
      to both the positive and negative inputs of a differential ADC.
      The first value specifies the positive input pin, the second
      specifies the negative input pin.
