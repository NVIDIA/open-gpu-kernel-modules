      8-bit dark gain compensation factor(4 int and 4 fractional bits - Q4.4)

    default: 0

  upisemi,lower-dark-gain:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint8
    description: |
      8-bit dark gain compensation factor(4 int and 4 fractional bits - Q4.4)
      applied when light < threshold.
    default: 0x16

  upisemi,continuous:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description: |
      This chip has two power modes: one-shot (chip takes one measurement and
      then shuts itself down) and continuous (chip takes continuous
      measurements). The one-shot mode is more power-friendly but the
      continuous mode may be more reliable. If this property is specified
      the continuous mode will be used instead of the default one-shot one for
      raw reads.
