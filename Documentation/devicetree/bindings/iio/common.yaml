description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to several iio
  sensors. It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification by itself but
  is meant to be referenced by device tree bindings.

  When referenced from sensor tree bindings the properties defined in this
  document are defined as follows. The sensor tree bindings are responsible for
  defining whether each property is required or optional.

properties:
  proximity-near-level:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      For proximity sensors whether an object can be considered near to the
      device depends on parameters like sensor position, covering glass and
      aperture. This value gives an indication to userspace for which
      sensor readings this is the case.

      Raw proximity values equal or above this level should be
      considered 'near' to the device (an object is near to the
      sensor).
