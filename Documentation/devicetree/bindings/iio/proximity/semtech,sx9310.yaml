  semtech,combined-sensors:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
    description: |
      List of which sensors are combined and represented by CS3.
      Possible values are -
      3        - CS3 (internal)
      0 1      - CS0 + CS1
      1 2      - CS1 + CS2 (default)

  semtech,startup-sensor:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    default: 0
    description:
      Sensor used for start-up proximity detection. The combined
      sensor is represented by the value 3. This is used for initial
      compensation.

    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [0, 2, 4, 8]
    default: 2
    description:
      PROXRAW filter strength. A value of 0 represents off, and other values
      represent 1-1/N.

    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [0, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 4294967295]
    default: 16
    description:
      Average positive filter strength. A value of 0 represents off and
      UINT_MAX (4294967295) represents infinite. Other values
      represent 1-1/N.
