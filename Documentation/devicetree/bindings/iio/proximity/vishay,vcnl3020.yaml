description: |
  The VCNL3020 is a fully integrated proximity sensor. Fully integrated means
  that the infrared emitter is included in the package. It has 16-bit
  resolution. It includes a signal processing IC and features standard I2C
  communication interface. It features an interrupt function.

  Specifications about the devices can be found at:
