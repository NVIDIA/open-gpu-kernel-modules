RT5651 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5651".

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:

- realtek,in2-differential
  Boolean. Indicate MIC2 input are differential, rather than single-ended.

- realtek,dmic-en
  Boolean. true if dmic is used.

- realtek,jack-detect-source
  u32. Valid values:
  1: Use JD1_1 pin for jack-detect
  2: Use JD1_2 pin for jack-detect
  3: Use JD2 pin for jack-detect

- realtek,jack-detect-not-inverted
  bool. Normal jack-detect switches give an inverted (active-low) signal,
  set this bool in the rare case you've a jack-detect switch which is not
  inverted.

- realtek,over-current-threshold-microamp
  u32, micbias over-current detection threshold in µA, valid values are
  600, 1500 and 2000µA.

- realtek,over-current-scale-factor
  u32, micbias over-current detection scale-factor, valid values are:
  0: Scale current by 0.5
  1: Scale current by 0.75
  2: Scale current by 1.0
  3: Scale current by 1.5
