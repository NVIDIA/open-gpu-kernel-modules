RT5650/RT5645 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : One of "realtek,rt5645" or "realtek,rt5650".

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

- avdd-supply: Power supply for AVDD, providing 1.8V.

- cpvdd-supply: Power supply for CPVDD, providing 3.5V.

Optional properties:

- hp-detect-gpios:
  a GPIO spec for the external headphone detect pin. If jd-mode = 0,
  we will get the JD status by getting the value of hp-detect-gpios.

- realtek,in2-differential
  Boolean. Indicate MIC2 input are differential, rather than single-ended.

- realtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using IN2P pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using GPIO6 pin as dmic1 data pin
  3: using GPIO10 pin as dmic1 data pin
  4: using GPIO12 pin as dmic1 data pin

- realtek,dmic2-data-pin
  0: dmic2 is not used
  1: using IN2N pin as dmic2 data pin
  2: using GPIO5 pin as dmic2 data pin
  3: using GPIO11 pin as dmic2 data pin

-- realtek,jd-mode : The JD mode of rt5645/rt5650
   0 : rt5645/rt5650 JD function is not used
   1 : Mode-0 (VDD=3.3V), two port jack detection
   2 : Mode-1 (VDD=3.3V), one port jack detection
   3 : Mode-2 (VDD=1.8V), one port jack detection
