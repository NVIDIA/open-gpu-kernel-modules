RT5668B audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5668b"

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

- realtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using GPIO2 pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using GPIO5 pin as dmic1 data pin

- realtek,dmic1-clk-pin
  0: using GPIO1 pin as dmic1 clock pin
  1: using GPIO3 pin as dmic1 clock pin

- realtek,jd-src
  0: No JD is used
  1: using JD1 as JD source

- realtek,ldo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's LDO1_EN pin.

Example:

rt5668 {
	compatible = "realtek,rt5668b";
	reg = <0x1a>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(U, 6) IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	realtek,ldo1-en-gpios =
		<&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(R, 2) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	realtek,dmic1-data-pin = <1>;
	realtek,dmic1-clk-pin = <1>;
	realtek,jd-src = <1>;
};
