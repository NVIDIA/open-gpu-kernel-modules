description: |
  Google's ChromeOS EC codec is a digital mic codec provided by the
  Embedded Controller (EC) and is controlled via a host-command
  interface.  An EC codec node should only be found inside the "codecs"
  subnode of a cros-ec node.
  (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/google,cros-ec.yaml).

    const: google,cros-ec-codec

          Physical base address and length of shared memory region from EC.
          It contains 3 unsigned 32-bit integer. The first 2 integers
          combine to become an unsigned 64-bit physical address.
          The last one integer is the length of the shared memory.
