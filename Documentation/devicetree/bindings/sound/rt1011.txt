RT1011 Mono Class D Audio Amplifier

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt1011".

- reg : The I2C address of the device. This I2C address decide by
        two input pins (ASEL1 and ASEL2).
        -------------------------------------
        |   ASEL2   |  ASEL1   |  Address   |
        -------------------------------------
        |     0     |    0     |   0x38     |
        -------------------------------------
        |     0     |    1     |   0x39     |
        -------------------------------------
        |     1     |    0     |   0x3a     |
        -------------------------------------
        |     1     |    1     |   0x3b     |
        -------------------------------------

Optional properties:

- realtek,temperature_calib
  u32. The temperature was measured while doing the calibration. Units: Celsius degree

- realtek,r0_calib
  u32. This is r0 calibration data which was measured in factory mode.

Example:

rt1011: codec@38 {
	compatible = "realtek,rt1011";
	reg = <0x38>;
	realtek,temperature_calib = <25>;
	realtek,r0_calib = <0x224050>;
};
