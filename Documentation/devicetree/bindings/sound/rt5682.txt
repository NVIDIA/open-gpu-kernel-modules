RT5682 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5682" or "realtek,rt5682i"

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

- realtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using GPIO2 pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using GPIO5 pin as dmic1 data pin

- realtek,dmic1-clk-pin
  0: using GPIO1 pin as dmic1 clock pin
  1: using GPIO3 pin as dmic1 clock pin

- realtek,jd-src
  0: No JD is used
  1: using JD1 as JD source

- realtek,ldo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's LDO1_EN pin.

- realtek,btndet-delay
  The debounce delay for push button.
  The delay time is realtek,btndet-delay value multiple of 8.192 ms.
  If absent, the default is 16.

- #clock-cells : Should be set to '<1>',  wclk and bclk sources provided.
- clock-output-names : Name given for DAI clocks output.

- clocks : phandle and clock specifier for codec MCLK.
- clock-names : Clock name string for 'clocks' attribute, should be "mclk".

- realtek,dmic-clk-rate-hz : Set the clock rate (hz) for the requirement of
  the particular DMIC.

- realtek,dmic-delay-ms : Set the delay time (ms) for the requirement of
  the particular DMIC.

- realtek,dmic-clk-driving-high : Set the high driving of the DMIC clock out.
