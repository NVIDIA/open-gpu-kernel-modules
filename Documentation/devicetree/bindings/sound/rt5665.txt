RT5665/RT5666 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : One of "realtek,rt5665", "realtek,rt5666".

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

Optional properties:

- realtek,in1-differential
- realtek,in2-differential
- realtek,in3-differential
- realtek,in4-differential
  Boolean. Indicate MIC1/2/3/4 input are differential, rather than single-ended.

- realtek,dmic1-data-pin
  0: dmic1 is not used
  1: using GPIO4 pin as dmic1 data pin
  2: using IN2N pin as dmic2 data pin

- realtek,dmic2-data-pin
  0: dmic2 is not used
  1: using GPIO5 pin as dmic2 data pin
  2: using IN2P pin as dmic2 data pin

- realtek,jd-src
  0: No JD is used
  1: using JD1 as JD source

- realtek,ldo1-en-gpios : The GPIO that controls the CODEC's LDO1_EN pin.
