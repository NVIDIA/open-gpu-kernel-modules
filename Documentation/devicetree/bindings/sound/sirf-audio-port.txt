* SiRF SoC audio port

Required properties:
- compatible: "sirf,audio-port"
- reg: Base address and size entries:
- dmas: List of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: Identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.

  One of the DMA channels will be responsible for transmission (should be
  named "tx") and one for reception (should be named "rx").

Example:

audioport: audioport@b0040000 {
	compatible = "sirf,audio-port";
	reg = <0xb0040000 0x10000>;
	dmas = <&dmac1 3>, <&dmac1 8>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};
