* Texas Instruments OMAP4+ and twl6040 based audio setups

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,abe-twl6040"
- ti,model: Name of the sound card ( for example "SDP4430")
- ti,mclk-freq: MCLK frequency for HPPLL operation
- ti,mcpdm: phandle for the McPDM node
- ti,twl6040: phandle for the twl6040 core node
- ti,audio-routing: List of connections between audio components.
  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's source.

Optional properties:
- ti,dmic: phandle for the OMAP dmic node if the machine have it connected
- ti,jack-detection: Need to be present if the board capable to detect jack
  insertion, removal.
