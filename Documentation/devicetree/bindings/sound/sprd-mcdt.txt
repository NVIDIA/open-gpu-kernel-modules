Spreadtrum Multi-Channel Data Transfer Binding

The Multi-channel data transfer controller is used for sound stream
transmission between audio subsystem and other AP/CP subsystem. It
supports 10 DAC channel and 10 ADC channel, and each channel can be
configured with DMA mode or interrupt mode.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sprd,sc9860-mcdt".
- reg: Should contain registers address and length.
- interrupts: Should contain one interrupt shared by all channel.

Example:

mcdt@41490000 {
	compatible = "sprd,sc9860-mcdt";
	reg = <0 0x41490000 0 0x170>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
