Analog Devices ADAU1701

Required properties:

 - compatible:		Should contain "adi,adau1701"
 - reg:			The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
			and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Optional properties:

 - reset-gpio: 		A GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the
			chip's !RESET pin. If specified, the driver will
			assert a hardware reset at probe time.
 - adi,pll-mode-gpios:	An array of two GPIO specs to describe the GPIOs
			the ADAU's PLL config pins are connected to.
			The state of the pins are set according to the
			configured clock divider on ASoC side before the
			firmware is loaded.
 - adi,pin-config:	An array of 12 numerical values selecting one of the
			pin configurations as described in the datasheet,
			table 53. Note that the value of this property has
			to be prefixed with '/bits/ 8'.
 - avdd-supply: 	Power supply for AVDD, providing 3.3V
 - dvdd-supply: 	Power supply for DVDD, providing 3.3V

Examples:

	i2c_bus {
		adau1701@34 {
			compatible = "adi,adau1701";
			reg = <0x34>;
			reset-gpio = <&gpio 23 0>;
			avdd-supply = <&vdd_3v3_reg>;
			dvdd-supply = <&vdd_3v3_reg>;
			adi,pll-mode-gpios = <&gpio 24 0 &gpio 25 0>;
			adi,pin-config = /bits/ 8 <0x4 0x7 0x5 0x5 0x4 0x4
                                                   0x4 0x4 0x4 0x4 0x4 0x4>;
		};
	};
