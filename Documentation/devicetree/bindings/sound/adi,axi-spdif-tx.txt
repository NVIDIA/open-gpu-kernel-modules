ADI AXI-SPDIF controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be "adi,axi-spdif-tx-1.00.a"
 - reg : Must contain SPDIF core's registers location and length
 - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the controller's clocks.
   The controller expects two clocks, the clock used for the AXI interface and
   the clock used as the sampling rate reference clock sample.
 - clock-names: "axi" for the clock to the AXI interface, "ref" for the sample
   rate reference clock.
 - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the DMA channel that is used by
   the core. The core expects one dma channel for transmit.
 - dma-names : Must be "tx"

Example:

	spdif: spdif@77400000 {
		compatible = "adi,axi-spdif-tx-1.00.a";
		reg = <0x77600000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk 15>, <&audio_clock>;
		clock-names = "axi", "ref";
		dmas = <&ps7_dma 0>;
		dma-names = "tx";
	};
