title: Cirrus Logic cs4234 audio CODEC

maintainers:
  - patches@opensource.cirrus.com

description:
  The CS4234 is a highly versatile CODEC that combines 4 channels of
  high performance analog to digital conversion, 4 channels of high
  performance digital to analog conversion for audio, and 1 channel of
  digital to analog conversion to provide a nondelayed audio reference
  signal to an external Class H tracking power supply. If not used to
  drive a tracking power supply, the 5th DAC can instead be used as a
  standard audio grade DAC, with performance specifications identical
  to that of the 4 DACs in the audio path. Additionally, the CS4234
  includes tunable group delay for each of the 4 audio DAC paths to
  provide lead time for the external switch-mode power supply, and a
  nondelayed path into the DAC outputs for input signals requiring a
  low-latency path to the outputs.
