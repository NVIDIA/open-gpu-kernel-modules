Broadcom Cygnus PCIe PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,cygnus-pcie-phy"
- reg: base address and length of the PCIe PHY block
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Each PCIe PHY should be represented by a child node

Required properties For the child node:
- reg: the PHY ID
0 - PCIe RC 0
1 - PCIe RC 1
- #phy-cells: must be 0

Example:
	pcie_phy: phy@301d0a0 {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x0301d0a0 0x14>;

		pcie0_phy: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		pcie1_phy: phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

	/* users of the PCIe phy */

	pcie0: pcie@18012000 {
		...
		...
		phys = <&pcie0_phy>;
		phy-names = "pcie-phy";
	};

	pcie1: pcie@18013000 {
		...
		...
		phys = <pcie1_phy>;
		phy-names = "pcie-phy";
	};
