* Broadcom NS2 PCIe PHY binding document

Required bus properties:
- reg: MDIO Bus number for the MDIO interface
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Required PHY properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy"
- reg: MDIO Phy ID for the MDIO interface
- #phy-cells: must be 0

This is a child bus node of "brcm,mdio-mux-iproc" node.

Example:

mdio@0 {
	reg = <0x0>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pci_phy0: pci-phy@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,ns2-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x0>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};
};
