Device tree binding documentation for am816x USB PHY
=========================

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "ti,dm816x-usb-phy"
- reg : offset and length of the PHY register set.
- reg-names : name for the phy registers
- clocks : phandle to the clock
- clock-names : name of the clock
- syscon: phandle for the syscon node to access misc registers
- #phy-cells : from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1
- syscon: phandle for the syscon node to access misc registers

Example:

usb_phy0: usb-phy@20 {
	compatible = "ti,dm8168-usb-phy";
	reg = <0x20 0x8>;
	reg-names = "phy";
	clocks = <&main_fapll 6>;
	clock-names = "refclk";
	#phy-cells = <0>;
	syscon = <&scm_conf>;
};
