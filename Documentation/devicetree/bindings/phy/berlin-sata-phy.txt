Berlin SATA PHY
---------------

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of
    "marvell,berlin2-sata-phy"
    "marvell,berlin2q-sata-phy"
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0
- phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1
- reg: address and length of the register
- clocks: reference to the clock entry

Sub-nodes:
Each PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number

Example:
	sata_phy: phy@f7e900a0 {
		compatible = "marvell,berlin2q-sata-phy";
		reg = <0xf7e900a0 0x200>;
		clocks = <&chip CLKID_SATA>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;

		sata-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};

		sata-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
