  # There are multiple known vendors who manufacture EEPROM chips compatible
  # with Atmel's AT25. The compatible string requires two items where the
  # 'vendor' and 'model' parts of the first are the actual chip and the second
  # item is fixed to "atmel,at25". Some existing bindings only have the
  # "atmel,at25" part and should be fixed by somebody who knows vendor and
  # product.
