description: |
  The SHTC1, SHTW1 and SHTC3 are digital humidity and temperature sensor
  designed especially for battery-driven high-volume consumer electronics
  applications.
  For further information refere to Documentation/hwmon/shtc1.rst

  This binding document describes the binding for the hardware monitor
  portion of the driver.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - sensirion,shtc1
      - sensirion,shtw1
      - sensirion,shtc3

  reg:
    const: 0x70

  sensirion,blocking-io:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description:
      If set, the driver hold the i2c bus until measurement is finished.

  sensirion,low-precision:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description:
      If set, the sensor aquire data with low precision (not recommended).
      The driver aquire data with high precision by default.
