description: |
  The TMP512 (dual-channel) and TMP513 (triple-channel) are system monitors
  that include remote sensors, a local temperature sensor, and a high-side
  current shunt monitor. These system monitors have the capability of measuring
  remote temperatures, on-chip temperatures, and system voltage/power/current
  consumption.

  shunt-resistor-micro-ohms:
    description: |
      If 0, the calibration process will be skiped and the current and power
      measurement engine will not work. Temperature and voltage measurement
      will continue to work. The shunt value also need to respect:
      rshunt <= pga-gain * 40 * 1000 * 1000.
      If not, it's not possible to compute a valid calibration value.
    default: 1000

  ti,pga-gain:
    description: |
      The gain value for the PGA function. This is 8, 4, 2 or 1.
      The PGA gain affect the shunt voltage range.
      The range will be equal to: pga-gain * 40mV

    description: |
      This is the operating range of the bus voltage in microvolt
    enum: [16000000, 32000000]
    default: 32000000

  ti,nfactor:
    description: |
      Array of three(TMP513) or two(TMP512) n-Factor value for each remote
      temperature channel.
      See datasheet Table 11 for n-Factor range list and value interpretation.
