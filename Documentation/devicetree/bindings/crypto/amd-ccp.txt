Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "amd,ccp-seattle-v1a"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the CCP interrupt

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent

Example:
	ccp@e0100000 {
		compatible = "amd,ccp-seattle-v1a";
		reg = <0 0xe0100000 0 0x10000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 3 4>;
	};
