* Atmel HW cryptographic accelerators

These are the HW cryptographic accelerators found on some Atmel products.

* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-aes".
- reg: Should contain AES registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the AES.
- dmas: List of two DMA specifiers as described in
        atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
- dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
             in the dmas property.

Example:
aes@f8038000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-aes";
	reg = <0xf8038000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <43 4 0>;
	dmas = <&dma1 2 18>,
	       <&dma1 2 19>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";

* Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-tdes".
- reg: Should contain TDES registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the TDES.

Optional properties:
- dmas: List of two DMA specifiers as described in
        atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
- dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
             in the dmas property.

Example:
tdes@f803c000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-tdes";
	reg = <0xf803c000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <44 4 0>;
	dmas = <&dma1 2 20>,
	       <&dma1 2 21>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
};

* Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha".
- reg: Should contain SHA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the SHA.

Optional properties:
- dmas: One DMA specifiers as described in
        atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
- dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
             in the dmas property. Only one "tx" string needed.

Example:
sha@f8034000 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha";
	reg = <0xf8034000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <42 4 0>;
	dmas = <&dma1 2 17>;
	dma-names = "tx";
};
