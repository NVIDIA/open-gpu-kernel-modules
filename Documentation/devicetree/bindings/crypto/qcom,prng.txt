Qualcomm MSM pseudo random number generator.

Required properties:

- compatible  : should be "qcom,prng" for 8916 etc
              : should be "qcom,prng-ee" for 8996 and later using EE
		(Execution Environment) slice of prng
- reg         : specifies base physical address and size of the registers map
- clocks      : phandle to clock-controller plus clock-specifier pair
- clock-names : "core" clocks all registers, FIFO and circuits in PRNG IP block

Example:

	rng@f9bff000 {
		compatible = "qcom,prng";
		reg = <0xf9bff000 0x200>;
		clocks = <&clock GCC_PRNG_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "core";
	};
