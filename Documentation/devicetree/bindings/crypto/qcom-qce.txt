Qualcomm crypto engine driver

Required properties:

- compatible  : should be "qcom,crypto-v5.1"
- reg         : specifies base physical address and size of the registers map
- clocks      : phandle to clock-controller plus clock-specifier pair
- clock-names : "iface" clocks register interface
                "bus" clocks data transfer interface
                "core" clocks rest of the crypto block
- dmas        : DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma channels. For more see
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names   : DMA request names should be "rx" and "tx"

Example:
	crypto@fd45a000 {
		compatible = "qcom,crypto-v5.1";
		reg = <0xfd45a000 0x6000>;
		clocks = <&gcc GCC_CE2_AHB_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_CE2_AXI_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_CE2_CLK>;
		clock-names = "iface", "bus", "core";
		dmas = <&cryptobam 2>, <&cryptobam 3>;
		dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	};
