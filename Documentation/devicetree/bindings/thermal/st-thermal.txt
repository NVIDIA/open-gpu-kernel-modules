Binding for Thermal Sensor driver for STMicroelectronics STi series of SoCs.

Required parameters:
-------------------

compatible : 	Should be "st,stih407-thermal"

clock-names : 	Should be "thermal".
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
clocks : 	Phandle of the clock used by the thermal sensor.
		  See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional parameters:
-------------------

reg : 		For non-sysconf based sensors, this should be the physical base
		address and length of the sensor's registers.
interrupts :	Standard way to define interrupt number.
		  NB: For thermal sensor's for which no interrupt has been
		  defined, a polling delay of 1000ms will be used to read the
		  temperature from device.

Example:

	temp0@91a0000 {
		compatible = "st,stih407-thermal";
		reg = <0x91a0000 0x28>;
		clock-names = "thermal";
		clocks = <&CLK_SYSIN>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 205 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		st,passive_cooling_temp = <110>;
	};
