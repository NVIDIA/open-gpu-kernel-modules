* Dove Thermal

This driver is for Dove SoCs which contain a thermal sensor.

Required properties:
- compatible : "marvell,dove-thermal"
- reg : Address range of the thermal registers

The reg properties should contain two ranges. The first is for the
three Thermal Manager registers, while the second range contains the
Thermal Diode Control Registers.

Example:

	thermal@10078 {
		compatible = "marvell,dove-thermal";
		reg = <0xd001c 0x0c>, <0xd005c 0x08>;
	};
