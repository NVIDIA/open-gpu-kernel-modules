* Broadcom STB thermal management

Thermal management core, provided by the AVS TMON hardware block.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of:
	"brcm,avs-tmon-bcm7216"
	"brcm,avs-tmon-bcm7445"
	"brcm,avs-tmon"
- reg: address range for the AVS TMON registers
- interrupts: temperature monitor interrupt, for high/low threshold triggers,
	      required except for "brcm,avs-tmon-bcm7216"
- interrupt-names: should be "tmon"

Example:

	thermal@f04d1500 {
		compatible = "brcm,avs-tmon-bcm7445", "brcm,avs-tmon";
		reg = <0xf04d1500 0x28>;
		interrupts = <0x6>;
		interrupt-names = "tmon";
		interrupt-parent = <&avs_host_l2_intc>;
	};
