STMicroelectronics HW Random Number Generator
----------------------------------------------

Required parameters:
compatible	: Should be "st,rng"
reg		: Base address and size of IP's register map.
clocks		: Phandle to device's clock (See: ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt)

Example:

rng@fee80000 {
	compatible      = "st,rng";
	reg		= <0xfee80000 0x1000>;
	clocks          = <&clk_sysin>;
}
