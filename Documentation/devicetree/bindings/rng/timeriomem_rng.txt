HWRNG support for the timeriomem_rng driver

Required properties:
- compatible : "timeriomem_rng"
- reg : base address to sample from
- period : wait time in microseconds to use between samples

Optional properties:
- quality : estimated number of bits of true entropy per 1024 bits read from the
            rng.  Defaults to zero which causes the kernel's default quality to
            be used instead.  Note that the default quality is usually zero
            which disables using this rng to automatically fill the kernel's
            entropy pool.

N.B. currently 'reg' must be at least four bytes wide and 32-bit aligned

Example:

hwrng@44 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "timeriomem_rng";
	reg = <0x44 0x04>;
	period = <1000000>;
};
