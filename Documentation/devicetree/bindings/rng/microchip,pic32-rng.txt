* Microchip PIC32 Random Number Generator

The PIC32 RNG provides a pseudo random number generator which can be seeded by
another true random number generator.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "microchip,pic32mzda-rng"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- clocks: clock phandle.

Example:

	rng: rng@1f8e6000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-rng";
		reg = <0x1f8e6000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&PBCLK5>;
	};
