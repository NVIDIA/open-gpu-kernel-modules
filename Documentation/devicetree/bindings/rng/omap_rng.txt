OMAP SoC and Inside-Secure HWRNG Module

Required properties:

- compatible : Should contain entries for this and backward compatible
  RNG versions:
  - "ti,omap2-rng" for OMAP2.
  - "ti,omap4-rng" for OMAP4, OMAP5 and AM33XX.
  - "inside-secure,safexcel-eip76" for SoCs with EIP76 IP block
  Note that these two versions are incompatible.
- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated with the RNG module
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the module
- interrupts : the interrupt number for the RNG module.
		Used for "ti,omap4-rng" and "inside-secure,safexcel-eip76"
- clocks: the trng clock source. Only mandatory for the
  "inside-secure,safexcel-eip76" compatible, the second clock is
  needed for the Armada 7K/8K SoCs
- clock-names: mandatory if there is a second clock, in this case the
  name must be "core" for the first clock and "reg" for the second
  one


Example:
/* AM335x */
rng: rng@48310000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-rng";
	ti,hwmods = "rng";
	reg = <0x48310000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <111>;
};

/* SafeXcel IP-76 */
trng: rng@f2760000 {
	compatible = "inside-secure,safexcel-eip76";
	reg = <0xf2760000 0x7d>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 59 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&cpm_syscon0 1 25>;
};
