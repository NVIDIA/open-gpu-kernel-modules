The APM X-Gene SLIMpro mailbox is used to communicate messages between
the ARM64 processors and the Cortex M3 (dubbed SLIMpro). It uses a simple
interrupt based door bell mechanism and can exchange simple messages using the
internal registers.

There are total of 8 interrupts in this mailbox. Each used for an individual
door bell (or mailbox channel).

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be as "apm,xgene-slimpro-mbox".

- reg:		Contains the mailbox register address range.

- interrupts:	8 interrupts must be from 0 to 7, interrupt 0 define the
		the interrupt for mailbox channel 0 and interrupt 1 for
		mailbox channel 1 and so likewise for the reminder.

- #mbox-cells:	only one to specify the mailbox channel number.

Example:

Mailbox Node:
		mailbox: mailbox@10540000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-slimpro-mbox";
			reg = <0x0 0x10540000 0x0 0xa000>;
			#mbox-cells = <1>;
			interrupts =  	<0x0 0x0 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x1 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x2 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x3 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x4 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x5 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x6 0x4>,
					<0x0 0x7 0x4>,
		};
