title: Texas Instruments' Secure Proxy

maintainers:

description: |
  The Texas Instruments' secure proxy is a mailbox controller that has
  configurable queues selectable at SoC(System on Chip) integration. The
  Message manager is broken up into different address regions that are
  called "threads" or "proxies" - each instance is unidirectional and is
  instantiated at SoC integration level by system controller to indicate
  receive or transmit path.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^mailbox@[0-9a-f]+$"

  compatible:
    const: ti,am654-secure-proxy

  "#mbox-cells":
    const: 1
    description:
      Contains the secure proxy thread ID used for the specific transfer path.

  reg-names:
    items:
      - const: target_data

    description:
      Contains the interrupt name information for the Rx interrupt path for
      secure proxy thread in the form 'rx_<PID>'.
