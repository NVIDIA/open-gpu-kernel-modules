Broadcom BCM7038 PWM controller (BCM7xxx Set Top Box PWM controller)

Required properties:

- compatible: must be "brcm,bcm7038-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length for this controller
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.yaml in this directory for a description
  of the cells format
- clocks: a phandle to the reference clock for this block which is fed through
  its internal variable clock frequency generator


Example:

	pwm: pwm@f0408000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7038-pwm";
		reg = <0xf0408000 0x28>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
		clocks = <&upg_fixed>;
	};
