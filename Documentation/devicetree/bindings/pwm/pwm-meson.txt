Amlogic Meson PWM Controller
============================

Required properties:
- compatible: Shall contain "amlogic,meson8b-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-gxbb-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-gxbb-ao-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-axg-ee-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-axg-ao-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-g12a-ee-pwm"
                         or "amlogic,meson-g12a-ao-pwm-ab"
                         or "amlogic,meson-g12a-ao-pwm-cd"
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.yaml in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.

Optional properties:
- clocks: Could contain one or two parents clocks phandle for each of the two
  PWM channels.
- clock-names: Could contain at least the "clkin0" and/or "clkin1" names.

Example:

	pwm_ab: pwm@8550 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-pwm";
		reg = <0x0 0x08550 0x0 0x10>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
		clocks = <&xtal>, <&xtal>;
		clock-names = "clkin0", "clkin1";
	}
