* OMAP PWM for dual-mode timers

Required properties:
- compatible: Shall contain "ti,omap-dmtimer-pwm".
- ti,timers: phandle to PWM capable OMAP timer. See timer/ti,timer.txt for info
  about these timers.
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.yaml in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.

Optional properties:
- ti,prescaler: Should be a value between 0 and 7, see the timers datasheet
- ti,clock-source: Set dmtimer parent clock, values between 0 and 2:
  - 0x00 - high-frequency system clock (timer_sys_ck)
  - 0x01 - 32-kHz always-on clock (timer_32k_ck)
  - 0x02 - external clock (timer_ext_ck, OMAP2 only)

Example:
	pwm9: dmtimer-pwm@9 {
		compatible = "ti,omap-dmtimer-pwm";
		ti,timers = <&timer9>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};
