SPI Master controller for Netlogic XLP MIPS64 SOCs
==================================================

Currently this SPI controller driver is supported for the following
Netlogic XLP SoCs:
	XLP832, XLP316, XLP208, XLP980, XLP532

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "netlogic,xlp832-spi".
- #address-cells	: Number of cells required to define a chip select address
			  on the SPI bus.
- #size-cells		: Should be zero.
- reg			: Should contain register location and length.
- clocks		: Phandle of the spi clock
- interrupts		: Interrupt number used by this controller.

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can contain
properties described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt.

Example:

	spi: xlp_spi@3a100 {
		compatible = "netlogic,xlp832-spi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x3a100 0x100>;
		clocks = <&spi_clk>;
		interrupts = <34>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pic>;

		spi_nor@1 {
			compatible = "spansion,s25sl12801";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			reg = <1>;	/* Chip Select */
			spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;
		};
};
