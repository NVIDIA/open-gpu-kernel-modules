* Marvell Armada 3700 SPI Controller

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-3700-spi"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
       region.
- interrupts: The interrupt number. The interrupt specifier format depends on
	      the interrupt controller and of its driver.
- clocks: Must contain the clock source, usually from the North Bridge clocks.
- num-cs: The number of chip selects that is supported by this SPI Controller
- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.

Example:

	spi0: spi@10600 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-spi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x10600 0x5d>;
		clocks = <&nb_perih_clk 7>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		num-cs = <4>;
	};
