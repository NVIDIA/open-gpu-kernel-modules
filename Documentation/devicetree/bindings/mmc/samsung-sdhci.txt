* Samsung's SDHCI Controller device tree bindings

Samsung's SDHCI controller is used as a connectivity interface with external
MMC, SD and eMMC storage mediums. This file documents differences between the
core mmc properties described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the
Samsung implementation of the SDHCI controller.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "samsung,s3c6410-sdhci": For controllers compatible with s3c6410 sdhci
    controller.
  - "samsung,exynos4210-sdhci": For controllers compatible with Exynos4 sdhci
    controller.

Required Board Specific Properties:
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

Example:
	sdhci@12530000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sdhci";
		reg = <0x12530000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		cd-gpios = <&gpk2 2 0>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sd0_clk &sd0_cmd &sd0_bus4>;
	};

	Note: This example shows both SoC specific and board specific properties
	in a single device node. The properties can be actually be separated
	into SoC specific node and board specific node.
