* Fujitsu SDHCI controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci_f_sdh30 driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "fujitsu,mb86s70-sdhci-3.0"
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names. It is a
  list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Should contain the following two entries:
	"iface" - clock used for sdhci interface
	"core"  - core clock for sdhci controller

Optional properties:
- vqmmc-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node, mentioned
  as the VCCQ/VDD_IO supply in the eMMC/SD specs.
- fujitsu,cmd-dat-delay-select: boolean property indicating that this host
  requires the CMD_DAT_DELAY control to be enabled.

Example:

	sdhci1: mmc@36600000 {
		compatible = "fujitsu,mb86s70-sdhci-3.0";
		reg = <0 0x36600000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 172 0x4>,
			     <0 173 0x4>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		vqmmc-supply = <&vccq_sdhci1>;
		clocks = <&clock 2 2 0>, <&clock 2 3 0>;
		clock-names = "iface", "core";
	};
