* Hisilicon specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Read synopsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hi3660-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi3660 specific extensions.
  - "hisilicon,hi3670-dw-mshc", "hisilicon,hi3660-dw-mshc": for controllers
     with hi3670 specific extensions.
  - "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi4511 specific extensions.
  - "hisilicon,hi6220-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi6220 specific extensions.

Optional Properties:
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: phandle of syscon used to control peripheral.
