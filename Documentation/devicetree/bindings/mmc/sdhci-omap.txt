* TI OMAP SDHCI Controller

Refer to mmc.txt for standard MMC bindings.

For UHS devices which require tuning, the device tree should have a "cpu_thermal" node which maps to the appropriate thermal zone. This is used to get the temperature of the zone during tuning.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ti,dra7-sdhci" for DRA7 and DRA72 controllers
	      Should be "ti,k2g-sdhci" for K2G
	      Should be "ti,am335-sdhci" for am335x controllers
	      Should be "ti,am437-sdhci" for am437x controllers
- ti,hwmods: Must be "mmc<n>", <n> is controller instance starting 1
	     (Not required for K2G).
- pinctrl-names: Should be subset of "default", "hs", "sdr12", "sdr25", "sdr50",
		 "ddr50-rev11", "sdr104-rev11", "ddr50", "sdr104",
		 "ddr_1_8v-rev11", "ddr_1_8v" or "ddr_3_3v", "hs200_1_8v-rev11",
		 "hs200_1_8v",
- pinctrl-<n> : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- dmas:		List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format as described
		in the generic DMA client binding. A tx and rx specifier is required.
- dma-names:	List of DMA request names. These strings correspond 1:1 with the
		DMA specifiers listed in dmas. The string naming is to be "tx"
		and "rx" for TX and RX DMA requests, respectively.

Example:
	mmc1: mmc@4809c000 {
		compatible = "ti,dra7-sdhci";
		reg = <0x4809c000 0x400>;
		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		dmas = <&sdma 61 &sdma 62>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
