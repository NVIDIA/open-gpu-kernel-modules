* SOCIONEXT Milbeaut SDHCI controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci_milbeaut driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "socionext,milbeaut-m10v-sdhci-3.0"
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names. It is a
  list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Should contain the following two entries:
	"iface" - clock used for sdhci interface
	"core"  - core clock for sdhci controller

Optional properties:
- fujitsu,cmd-dat-delay-select: boolean property indicating that this host
  requires the CMD_DAT_DELAY control to be enabled.

Example:
	sdhci3: mmc@1b010000 {
		compatible = "socionext,milbeaut-m10v-sdhci-3.0";
		reg = <0x1b010000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 265 0x4>;
		voltage-ranges = <3300 3300>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		clocks = <&clk 7>, <&ahb_clk>;
		clock-names = "core", "iface";
		cap-sdio-irq;
		fujitsu,cmd-dat-delay-select;
	};
