MMC/SD/SDIO slot directly connected to a SPI bus

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the mmc_spi driver.

Required properties:
- spi-max-frequency : maximum frequency for this device (Hz).

Optional properties:
- voltage-ranges : two cells are required, first cell specifies minimum
  slot voltage (mV), second cell specifies maximum slot voltage (mV).
  Several ranges could be specified. If not provided, 3.2v..3.4v is assumed.
- gpios : may specify GPIOs in this order: Card-Detect GPIO,
  Write-Protect GPIO. Note that this does not follow the
  binding from mmc.txt, for historical reasons.

Example:

	mmc-slot@0 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8323rdb-mmc-slot",
			     "mmc-spi-slot";
		reg = <0>;
		gpios = <&qe_pio_d 14 1
			 &qe_pio_d 15 0>;
		voltage-ranges = <3300 3300>;
		spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
		interrupts = <42>;
		interrupt-parent = <&PIC>;
	};
