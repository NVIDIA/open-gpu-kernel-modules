Broadcom BCM2835 SDHOST controller

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties that represent the BCM2835 controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm2835-sdhost".
- clocks: The clock feeding the SDHOST controller.

Optional properties:
- dmas: DMA channel for read and write.
          See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt for details

Example:

sdhost: mmc@7e202000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-sdhost";
	reg = <0x7e202000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <2 24>;
	clocks = <&clocks BCM2835_CLOCK_VPU>;
	dmas = <&dma 13>;
	dma-names = "rx-tx";
};
