* TI Highspeed MMC host controller for DaVinci

The Highspeed MMC Host Controller on TI DaVinci family
provides an interface for MMC, SD and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents the properties used by the davinci_mmc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 Should be "ti,da830-mmc": for da830, da850, dm365
 Should be "ti,dm355-mmc": for dm355, dm644x

Optional properties:
- bus-width: Number of data lines, can be <1>, <4>, or <8>, default <1>
- max-frequency: Maximum operating clock frequency, default 25MHz.
- dmas: List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format
	as described in the generic DMA client binding. A tx and rx
	specifier is required.
- dma-names: RX and TX  DMA request names. These strings correspond
	1:1 with the DMA specifiers listed in dmas.

Example:
mmc0: mmc@1c40000 {
	compatible = "ti,da830-mmc",
	reg = <0x40000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <16>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	max-frequency = <50000000>;
	dmas = <&edma 16
		&edma 17>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};
