Broadcom BCM281xx SDHCI

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties present in the bcm281xx SDHCI

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,kona-sdhci"
- DEPRECATED: compatible : Should be "bcm,kona-sdhci"
- clocks: phandle + clock specifier pair of the external clock

Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties.

Example:

sdio2: sdio@3f1a0000 {
	compatible = "brcm,kona-sdhci";
	reg = <0x3f1a0000 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&sdio3_clk>;
	interrupts = <0x0 74 0x4>;
};
