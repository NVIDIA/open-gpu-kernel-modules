* Wondermedia WM8505/WM8650 SD/MMC Host Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the wmt-sdmmc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "wm,wm8505-sdhc".
- interrupts: Two interrupts are required - regular irq and dma irq.

Optional properties:
- sdon-inverted: SD_ON bit is inverted on the controller

Examples:

sdhc@d800a000 {
	compatible = "wm,wm8505-sdhc";
	reg = <0xd800a000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <20 21>;
	clocks = <&sdhc>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	sdon-inverted;
};
