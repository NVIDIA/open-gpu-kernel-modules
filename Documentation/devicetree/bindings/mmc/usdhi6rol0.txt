* Renesas usdhi6rol0 SD/SDIO host controller

Required properties:

- compatible:	must be
		"renesas,usdhi6rol0"
- interrupts:	3 interrupts, named "card detect", "data" and "SDIO" must be
		specified
- clocks:	a clock binding for the IMCLK input

Optional properties:

- vmmc-supply:	a phandle of a regulator, supplying Vcc to the card
- vqmmc-supply:	a phandle of a regulator, supplying VccQ to the card
- pinctrl-names: Can contain a "default" entry and a "state_uhs"
                 entry. The state_uhs entry is used together with the default
                 entry when the board requires distinct settings for UHS speeds.

- pinctrl-N: One property for each name listed in pinctrl-names, see
             ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

Additionally any standard mmc bindings from mmc.txt can be used.

Example:

sd0: sd@ab000000 {
	compatible = "renesas,usdhi6rol0";
	reg = <0xab000000 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 23 0x4
		      0 24 0x4
		      0 25 0x4>;
	interrupt-names = "card detect", "data", "SDIO";
	bus-width = <4>;
	max-frequency = <50000000>;
	cap-power-off-card;
	clocks = <&imclk>;
	vmmc-supply = <&vcc_sd0>;
	vqmmc-supply = <&vccq_sd0>;
};
