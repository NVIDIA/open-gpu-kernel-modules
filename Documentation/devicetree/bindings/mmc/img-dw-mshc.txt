* Imagination specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage
  Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Imagination specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "img,pistachio-dw-mshc": for Pistachio SoCs

Example:

	mmc@18142000 {
		compatible = "img,pistachio-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x18142000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 39 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		clocks = <&system_clk>, <&sdhost_clk>;
		clock-names = "biu", "ciu";

		fifo-depth = <0x20>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		disable-wp;
	};
