* Hisilicon Hi3798CV200 specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Read synopsys-dw-mshc.txt for more details

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon Hi3798CV200
specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should contain "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-dw-mshc".
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"ciu" - The ciu clock described in synopsys-dw-mshc.txt.
	"biu" - The biu clock described in synopsys-dw-mshc.txt.
	"ciu-sample" - Hi3798CV200 extended phase clock for ciu sampling.
	"ciu-drive"  - Hi3798CV200 extended phase clock for ciu driving.

Example:

	emmc: mmc@9830000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x9830000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 35 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&crg HISTB_MMC_CIU_CLK>,
			 <&crg HISTB_MMC_BIU_CLK>,
			 <&crg HISTB_MMC_SAMPLE_CLK>,
			 <&crg HISTB_MMC_DRV_CLK>;
		clock-names = "ciu", "biu", "ciu-sample", "ciu-drive";
		fifo-depth = <256>;
		clock-frequency = <200000000>;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
		mmc-ddr-1_8v;
		mmc-hs200-1_8v;
		non-removable;
		bus-width = <8>;
	};
