* Altera SOCFPGA specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Altera SOCFPGA specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc": for Altera's SOCFPGA platform

Example:

	mmc: dwmmc0@ff704000 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0xff704000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 129 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
