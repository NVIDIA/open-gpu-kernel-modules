* Microchip PIC32 SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-pic32 driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32mzda-sdhci"
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt
- clock-names: Should be "base_clk", "sys_clk".
               See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
- clocks: Phandle to the clock.
          See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state names "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0: Phandle referencing pin configuration of the SDHCI controller.
             See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

Example:

	sdhci@1f8ec000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-sdhci";
		reg = <0x1f8ec000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <191 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&rootclk REF4CLK>, <&rootclk PB5CLK>;
		clock-names = "base_clk", "sys_clk";
		bus-width = <4>;
		cap-sd-highspeed;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_sdhc1>;
	};
