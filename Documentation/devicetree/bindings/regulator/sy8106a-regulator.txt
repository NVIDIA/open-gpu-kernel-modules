SY8106A Voltage regulator

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "silergy,sy8106a"
- reg: I2C slave address - must be <0x65>
- silergy,fixed-microvolt - the voltage when I2C regulating is disabled (set
  by external resistor like a fixed voltage)

Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding, defined in
./regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:

	sy8106a {
		compatible = "silergy,sy8106a";
		reg = <0x65>;
		regulator-name = "sy8106a-vdd";
		silergy,fixed-microvolt = <1200000>;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
		regulator-boot-on;
		regulator-always-on;
	};
