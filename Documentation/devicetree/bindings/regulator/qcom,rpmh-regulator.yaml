description: |
    rpmh-regulator devices support PMIC regulator management via the Voltage
    Regulator Manager (VRM) and Oscillator Buffer (XOB) RPMh accelerators.
    The APPS processor communicates with these hardware blocks via a
    Resource State Coordinator (RSC) using command packets.  The VRM allows
    changing three parameters for a given regulator, enable state, output
    voltage, and operating mode.  The XOB allows changing only a single
    parameter for a given regulator, its enable state.  Despite its name,
    the XOB is capable of controlling the enable state of any PMIC peripheral.
    It is used for clock buffers, low-voltage switches, and LDO/SMPS regulators
    which have a fixed voltage and mode.

    =======================
    Required Node Structure
    =======================

    RPMh regulators must be described in two levels of device nodes.  The first
    level describes the PMIC containing the regulators and must reside within an
    RPMh device node.  The second level describes each regulator within the PMIC
    which is to be used on the board.  Each of these regulators maps to a single
    RPMh resource.

    The names used for regulator nodes must match those supported by a given
    PMIC. Supported regulator node names are
      For PM8005, smps1 - smps4
      For PM8009, smps1 - smps2, ldo1 - ldo7
      For PM8150, smps1 - smps10, ldo1 - ldo18
      For PM8150L, smps1 - smps8, ldo1 - ldo11, bob, flash, rgb
      For PM8350, smps1 - smps12, ldo1 - ldo10
      For PM8350C, smps1 - smps10, ldo1 - ldo13, bob
      For PM8998, smps1 - smps13, ldo1 - ldo28, lvs1 - lvs2
      For PMI8998, bob
      For PM6150, smps1 - smps5, ldo1 - ldo19
      For PM6150L, smps1 - smps8, ldo1 - ldo11, bob
      For PMX55, smps1 - smps7, ldo1 - ldo16
      For PM7325, smps1 - smps8, ldo1 - ldo19
      For PMR735A, smps1 - smps3, ldo1 - ldo7
