Marvell 88PM800 regulator

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,88pm800"
- reg: I2C slave address
- regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator within the
  device. Each sub-node is identified using the node's name (or the deprecated
  regulator-compatible property if present), with valid values listed below.
  The content of each sub-node is defined by the standard binding for
  regulators; see regulator.txt.

The valid names for regulators are:

  buck1, buck2, buck3, buck4, buck5, ldo1, ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5, ldo6, ldo7,
  ldo8, ldo9, ldo10, ldo11, ldo12, ldo13, ldo14, ldo15, ldo16, ldo17, ldo18, ldo19

Example:

	pmic: 88pm800@31 {
		compatible = "marvell,88pm800";
		reg = <0x31>;

		regulators {
			buck1 {
			        regulator-min-microvolt = <600000>;
			        regulator-max-microvolt = <3950000>;
			        regulator-boot-on;
			        regulator-always-on;
			};
			ldo1 {
			        regulator-min-microvolt = <600000>;
			        regulator-max-microvolt = <15000000>;
			        regulator-boot-on;
			        regulator-always-on;
			};
...
		};
	};
