Mediatek MT6311 Regulator

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt6311-regulator"
- reg: I2C slave address, usually 0x6b.
- regulators: List of regulators provided by this controller. It is named
  to VDVFS and VBIASN.
  The definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard binding
  for regulators at Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

The valid names for regulators are:
BUCK:
  VDVFS
LDO:
  VBIASN

Example:
	mt6311: pmic@6b {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6311-regulator";
		reg = <0x6b>;

		regulators {
			mt6311_vcpu_reg: VDVFS {
				regulator-name = "VDVFS";
				regulator-min-microvolt = < 600000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
				regulator-ramp-delay = <10000>;
			};
			mt6311_ldo_reg: VBIASN {
				regulator-name = "VBIASN";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <200000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <800000>;
			};
		};
	};
