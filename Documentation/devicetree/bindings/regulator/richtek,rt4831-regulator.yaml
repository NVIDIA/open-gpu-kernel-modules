title: Richtek RT4831 Display Bias Voltage Regulator

description: |
  RT4831 is a multifunctional device that can provide power to the LCD display
  and LCD backlight.

  For Display Bias Voltage DSVP and DSVN, the output range is about 4V to 6.5V.
  It is sufficient to meet the current LCD power requirement.

  DSVLCM is a boost regulator in IC internal as DSVP and DSVN input power.
  Its voltage should be configured above 0.15V to 0.2V gap larger than the
  voltage needed for DSVP and DSVN. Too much voltage gap could improve the
  voltage drop from the heavy loading scenario. But it also make the power
  efficiency worse. It's a trade-off.
