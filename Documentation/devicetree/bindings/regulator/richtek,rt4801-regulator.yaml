description: |
  Regulator nodes should be named to DSVP and DSVN. The
  definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
  binding for regulators at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
  Datasheet is available at
  https://www.richtek.com/assets/product_file/RT4801H/DS4801H-00.pdf

#The valid names for RT4801 regulator nodes are:
#DSVP, DSVN

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - richtek,rt4801

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  enable-gpios:
    description: GPIOs to use to enable DSVP/DSVN regulator.
      The first one is ENP to enable DSVP, and second one is ENM to enable DSVN.
      Number of GPIO in the array list could be 1 or 2.
      If only one gpio is specified, only one gpio used to control ENP/ENM.
      Else both are spefied, DSVP/DSVN could be controlled individually.
      Othersie, this property not specified. treat both as always-on regulator.
