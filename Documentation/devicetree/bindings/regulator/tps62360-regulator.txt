TPS62360 Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of the following.
	"ti,tps62360"
	"ti,tps62361",
	"ti,tps62362",
	"ti,tps62363",
- reg: I2C slave address

Optional properties:
- ti,enable-vout-discharge: Enable output discharge. This is boolean value.
- ti,enable-pull-down: Enable pull down. This is boolean value.
- ti,vsel0-gpio: GPIO for controlling VSEL0 line.
  If this property is missing, then assume that there is no GPIO
  for vsel0 control.
- ti,vsel1-gpio: Gpio for controlling VSEL1 line.
  If this property is missing, then assume that there is no GPIO
  for vsel1 control.
- ti,vsel0-state-high: Initial state of vsel0 input is high.
  If this property is missing, then assume the state as low (0).
- ti,vsel1-state-high: Initial state of vsel1 input is high.
  If this property is missing, then assume the state as low (0).

Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding, defined in
regulator.txt, can also be used.

Example:

	abc: tps62360 {
		compatible = "ti,tps62361";
		reg =  <0x60>;
		regulator-name = "tps62361-vout";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <500000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1500000>;
		regulator-boot-on
		ti,vsel0-gpio = <&gpio1 16 0>;
		ti,vsel1-gpio = <&gpio1 17 0>;
		ti,vsel0-state-high;
		ti,vsel1-state-high;
		ti,enable-pull-down;
		ti,enable-force-pwm;
		ti,enable-vout-discharge;
	};
