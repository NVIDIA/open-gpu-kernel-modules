* SPEAr SMI

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,spear600-smi"
- reg : Address range of the mtd chip
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- clock-rate : Functional clock rate of SMI in Hz

Optional properties:
- st,smi-fast-mode : Flash supports read in fast mode

Example:

	smi: flash@fc000000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-smi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xfc000000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <12>;
		clock-rate = <50000000>;	/* 50MHz */

		flash@f8000000 {
			st,smi-fast-mode;
			...
		};
	};
