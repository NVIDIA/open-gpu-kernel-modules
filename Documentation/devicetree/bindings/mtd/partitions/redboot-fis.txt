RedBoot FLASH Image System (FIS) Partitions
===========================================

The FLASH Image System (FIS) directory is a flash description
format closely associated with the RedBoot boot loader.

It uses one single flash eraseblock in the flash to store an index of
all images in the flash.

This block size will vary depending on flash but is typically
32 KB in size.

Required properties:
- compatible : (required) must be "redboot-fis"
- fis-index-block : (required) a index to the eraseblock containing
  the FIS directory on this device. On a flash memory with 32KB
  eraseblocks, 0 means the first eraseblock at 0x00000000, 1 means the
  second eraseblock at 0x00008000 and so on.

Example:

flash@0 {
	partitions {
		compatible = "redboot-fis";
		fis-index-block = <0>;
	};
};
