* NXP SPI Flash Interface (SPIFI)

NXP SPIFI is a specialized SPI interface for serial Flash devices.
It supports one Flash device with 1-, 2- and 4-bits width in SPI
mode 0 or 3. The controller operates in either command or memory
mode. In memory mode the Flash is accessible from the CPU as
normal memory.

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "nxp,lpc1773-spifi"
  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
          the second contains the memory mapping address and length
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "spifi" and "flash"
  - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the device
  - clocks : The clocks needed by the SPIFI controller
  - clock-names : Should contain the clock names "spifi" and "reg"

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier

The SPI Flash must be a child of the SPIFI node and must have a
compatible property as specified in bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.txt

Optionally it can also contain the following properties.
 - spi-cpol : Controller only supports mode 0 and 3 so either
              both spi-cpol and spi-cpha should be present or
              none of them
 - spi-cpha : See above
 - spi-rx-bus-width : Used to select how many pins that are used
                      for input on the controller

See bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt for more information.

Example:
spifi: spifi@40003000 {
	compatible = "nxp,lpc1773-spifi";
	reg = <0x40003000 0x1000>, <0x14000000 0x4000000>;
	reg-names = "spifi", "flash";
	interrupts = <30>;
	clocks = <&ccu1 CLK_SPIFI>, <&ccu1 CLK_CPU_SPIFI>;
	clock-names = "spifi", "reg";
	resets = <&rgu 53>;

	flash@0 {
		compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;
		spi-rx-bus-width = <4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		partition@0 {
			label = "data";
			reg = <0 0x200000>;
		};
	};
};
