Macronix Raw NAND Controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "mxic,multi-itfc-v009-nand-controller"
- reg: should contain 1 entry for the registers
- #address-cells: should be set to 1
- #size-cells: should be set to 0
- interrupts: interrupt line connected to this raw NAND controller
- clock-names: should contain "ps", "send" and "send_dly"
- clocks: should contain 3 phandles for the "ps", "send" and
	 "send_dly" clocks

Children nodes:
- children nodes represent the available NAND chips.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/nand-controller.yaml
for more details on generic bindings.

Example:

	nand: nand-controller@43c30000 {
		compatible = "mxic,multi-itfc-v009-nand-controller";
		reg = <0x43c30000 0x10000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0x1d IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&clkwizard 0>, <&clkwizard 1>, <&clkc 15>;
		clock-names = "send", "send_dly", "ps";

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			nand-ecc-mode = "soft";
			nand-ecc-algo = "bch";
		};
	};
