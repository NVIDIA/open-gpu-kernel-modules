* Common properties of all MTD devices

Optional properties:
- label: user-defined MTD device name. Can be used to assign user
  friendly names to MTD devices (instead of the flash model or flash
  controller based name) in order to ease flash device identification
  and/or describe what they are used for.

Example:

	flash@0 {
		label = "System-firmware";

		/* flash type specific properties */
	};
