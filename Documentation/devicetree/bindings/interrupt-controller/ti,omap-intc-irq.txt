Omap2/3 intc controller

On TI omap2 and 3 the intc interrupt controller can provide
96 or 128 IRQ signals to the ARM host depending on the SoC.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of
			"ti,omap2-intc"
			"ti,omap3-intc"
			"ti,dm814-intc"
			"ti,dm816-intc"
			"ti,am33xx-intc"

- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode interrupt
		     source, should be 1 for intc
- interrupts: interrupt reference to primary interrupt controller

Please refer to interrupts.txt in this directory for details of the common
Interrupt Controllers bindings used by client devices.

Example:
	intc: interrupt-controller@48200000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap3-intc";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x48200000 0x1000>;
	};
