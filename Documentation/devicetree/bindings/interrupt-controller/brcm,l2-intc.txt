Broadcom Generic Level 2 Interrupt Controller

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of:
	      "brcm,hif-spi-l2-intc" or
	      "brcm,upg-aux-aon-l2-intc" or
	      "brcm,l2-intc" for latched interrupt controllers
              should be "brcm,bcm7271-l2-intc" for level interrupt controllers
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Should be 1.
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line in the interrupt-parent irq space
  to be used for cascading

Optional properties:

- brcm,irq-can-wake: If present, this means the L2 controller can be used as a
  wakeup source for system suspend/resume.

Example:

hif_intr2_intc: interrupt-controller@f0441000 {
	compatible = "brcm,l2-intc";
	reg = <0xf0441000 0x30>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x20 0x0>;
};
