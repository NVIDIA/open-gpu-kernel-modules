Amazon's Annapurna Labs Fabric Interrupt Controller

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "amazon,al-fic"
- reg: physical base address and size of the registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : must be 2. Specifies the number of cells needed to encode
  an interrupt source. Supported trigger types are low-to-high edge
  triggered and active high level-sensitive.
- interrupts: describes which input line in the interrupt parent, this
  fic's output is connected to. This field property depends on the parent's
  binding

Please refer to interrupts.txt in this directory for details of the common
Interrupt Controllers bindings used by client devices.

Example:

amazon_fic: interrupt-controller@fd8a8500 {
	compatible = "amazon,al-fic";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x0 0xfd8a8500 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
