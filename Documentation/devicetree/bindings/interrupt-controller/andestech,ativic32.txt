* Andestech Internal Vector Interrupt Controller

The Internal Vector Interrupt Controller (IVIC) is a basic interrupt controller
suitable for a simpler SoC platform not requiring a more sophisticated and
bigger External Vector Interrupt Controller.


Main node required properties:

- compatible : should at least contain  "andestech,ativic32".
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: 1 cells and refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts

Examples:
	intc: interrupt-controller {
		compatible = "andestech,ativic32";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
	};
