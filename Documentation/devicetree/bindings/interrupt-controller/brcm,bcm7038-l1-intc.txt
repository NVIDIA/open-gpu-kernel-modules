Broadcom BCM7038-style Level 1 interrupt controller

This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.  Every BCM7xxx set-top chip
since BCM7038 has contained this hardware.

Key elements of the hardware design include:

- 64, 96, 128, or 160 incoming level IRQ lines

- Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

- A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual
  peripheral IRQs to be routed to any CPU

- Atomic mask/unmask operations

- No polarity/level/edge settings

- No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
  2-5 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm7038-l1-intc"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers;
  the number of supported IRQs is inferred from the size argument
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
  node; valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller

Optional properties:

- brcm,irq-can-wake: If present, this means the L1 controller can be used as a
  wakeup source for system suspend/resume.

Optional properties:

- brcm,int-fwd-mask: if present, a bit mask to indicate which interrupts
  have already been configured by the firmware and should be left unmanaged.
  This should have one 32-bit word per status/set/clear/mask group.

If multiple reg ranges and interrupt-parent entries are present on an SMP
system, the driver will allow IRQ SMP affinity to be set up through the
/proc/irq/ interface.  In the simplest possible configuration, only one
reg range and one interrupt-parent is needed.

Example:

periph_intc: periph_intc@1041a400 {
        compatible = "brcm,bcm7038-l1-intc";
        reg = <0x1041a400 0x30 0x1041a600 0x30>;

        interrupt-controller;
        #interrupt-cells = <1>;

        interrupt-parent = <&cpu_intc>;
        interrupts = <2>, <3>;
};
