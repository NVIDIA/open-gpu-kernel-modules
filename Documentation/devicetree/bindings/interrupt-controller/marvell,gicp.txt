Marvell GICP Controller
-----------------------

GICP is a Marvell extension of the GIC that allows to trigger GIC SPI
interrupts by doing a memory transaction. It is used by the ICU
located in the Marvell CP110 to turn wired interrupts inside the CP
into GIC SPI interrupts.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "marvell,ap806-gicp"

- reg: Must be the address and size of the GICP SPI registers

- marvell,spi-ranges: tuples of GIC SPI interrupts ranges available
  for this GICP

- msi-controller: indicates that this is an MSI controller

Example:

gicp_spi: gicp-spi@3f0040 {
	compatible = "marvell,ap806-gicp";
	reg = <0x3f0040 0x10>;
	marvell,spi-ranges = <64 64>, <288 64>;
	msi-controller;
};
