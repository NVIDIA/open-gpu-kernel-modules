Marvell Armada 7K/8K PIC Interrupt controller
---------------------------------------------

This is the Device Tree binding for the PIC, a secondary interrupt
controller available on the Marvell Armada 7K/8K ARM64 SoCs, and
typically connected to the GIC as the primary interrupt controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-8k-pic"
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to define interrupts on this
  controller. Should be 1
- reg: the register area for the PIC interrupt controller
- interrupts: the interrupt to the primary interrupt controller,
  typically the GIC

Example:

	pic: interrupt-controller@3f0100 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-8k-pic";
		reg = <0x3f0100 0x10>;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupts = <GIC_PPI 15 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
