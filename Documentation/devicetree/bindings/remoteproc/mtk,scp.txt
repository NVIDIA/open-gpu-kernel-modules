Mediatek SCP Bindings
----------------------------------------

This binding provides support for ARM Cortex M4 Co-processor found on some
Mediatek SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible		Should be "mediatek,mt8183-scp"
- reg			Should contain the address ranges for memory regions:
			SRAM, CFG, and L1TCM.
- reg-names		Contains the corresponding names for the memory regions:
			"sram", "cfg", and "l1tcm".
- clocks		Clock for co-processor (See: ../clock/clock-bindings.txt)
- clock-names		Contains the corresponding name for the clock. This
			should be named "main".

Subnodes
--------

Subnodes of the SCP represent rpmsg devices. The names of the devices are not
important. The properties of these nodes are defined by the individual bindings
for the rpmsg devices - but must contain the following property:

- mtk,rpmsg-name	Contains the name for the rpmsg device. Used to match
			the subnode to rpmsg device announced by SCP.

Example:

	scp: scp@10500000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-scp";
		reg = <0 0x10500000 0 0x80000>,
		      <0 0x105c0000 0 0x5000>;
		reg-names = "sram", "cfg";
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_SCPSYS>;
		clock-names = "main";
	};
