STMicroelectronics Co-Processor Bindings
----------------------------------------

This binding provides support for adjunct processors found on ST SoCs.

Co-processors can be controlled from the bootloader or the primary OS. If
the bootloader starts a co-processor, the primary OS must detect its state
and act accordingly.

Required properties:
- compatible		Should be one of:
				"st,st231-rproc"
				"st,st40-rproc"
- memory-region		Reserved memory (See: ../reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt)
- resets		Reset lines (See: ../reset/reset.txt)
- reset-names		Must be "sw_reset" and "pwr_reset"
- clocks		Clock for co-processor (See: ../clock/clock-bindings.txt)
- clock-frequency	Clock frequency to set co-processor at if the bootloader
			hasn't already done so
- st,syscfg		System configuration register which holds the boot vector
			for the co-processor
				1st cell: Phandle to syscon block
				2nd cell: Boot vector register offset

Example:

	audio_reserved: rproc@42000000 {
		compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
		reg = <0x42000000 0x01000000>;
		no-map;
	};

	st231-audio {
		compatible	= "st,st231-rproc";
		memory-region	= <&audio_reserved>;
		resets		= <&softreset STIH407_ST231_AUD_SOFTRESET>;
		reset-names	= "sw_reset";
		clocks		= <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_ST231_AUD_0>;
		clock-frequency	= <600000000>;
		st,syscfg	= <&syscfg_core 0x228>;
	};
