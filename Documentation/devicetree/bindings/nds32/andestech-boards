Andestech(nds32) AE3XX Platform
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AE3XX prototype demonstrates the AE3XX example platform on the FPGA. It
is composed of one Andestech(nds32) processor and AE3XX.

Required properties (in root node):
- compatible = "andestech,ae3xx";

Example:
/dts-v1/;
/ {
	compatible = "andestech,ae3xx";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
};

Andestech(nds32) AG101P Platform
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AG101P is a generic SoC Platform IP that works with any of Andestech(nds32)
processors to provide a cost-effective and high performance solution for
majority of embedded systems in variety of application domains. Users may
simply attach their IP on one of the system buses together with certain glue
logics to complete a SoC solution for a specific application. With
comprehensive simulation and design environments, users may evaluate the
system performance of their applications and track bugs of their designs
efficiently. The optional hardware development platform further provides real
system environment for early prototyping and software/hardware co-development.

Required properties (in root node):
	compatible = "andestech,ag101p";

Example:
/dts-v1/;
/ {
	compatible = "andestech,ag101p";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
};
