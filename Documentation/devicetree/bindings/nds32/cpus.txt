* Andestech Processor Binding

This binding specifies what properties must be available in the device tree
representation of a Andestech Processor Core, which is the root node in the
tree.

Required properties:

	- compatible:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: Should be "andestech,<core_name>", "andestech,nds32v3" as fallback.
		Must contain "andestech,nds32v3" as the most generic value, in addition to
		one of the following identifiers for a particular CPU core:
		"andestech,n13"
		"andestech,n15"
		"andestech,d15"
		"andestech,n10"
		"andestech,d10"
	- device_type
		Usage: required
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: must be "cpu"
	- reg: Contains CPU index.
	- clock-frequency: Contains the clock frequency for CPU, in Hz.

* Examples

/ {
	cpus {
		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "andestech,n13", "andestech,nds32v3";
			reg = <0x0>;
			clock-frequency = <60000000>
		};
	};
};
