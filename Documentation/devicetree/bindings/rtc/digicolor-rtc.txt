Conexant Digicolor Real Time Clock controller

This binding currently supports the CX92755 SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "cnxt,cx92755-rtc"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: rtc alarm interrupt

Example:

	rtc@f0000c30 {
		compatible = "cnxt,cx92755-rtc";
		reg = <0xf0000c30 0x18>;
		interrupts = <25>;
	};
