* Faraday Technology FTRTC010 Real Time Clock

This RTC appears in for example the Storlink Gemini family of
SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of:
  "faraday,ftrtc010"
  "cortina,gemini-rtc", "faraday,ftrtc010"

Optional properties:
- clocks: when present should contain clock references to the
  PCLK and EXTCLK clocks. Faraday calls the later CLK1HZ and
  says the clock should be 1 Hz, but implementers actually seem
  to choose different clocks here, like Cortina who chose
  32768 Hz (a typical low-power clock).
- clock-names: should name the clocks "PCLK" and "EXTCLK"
  respectively.

Examples:

rtc@45000000 {
	compatible = "cortina,gemini-rtc";
	reg = <0x45000000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&foo 0>, <&foo 1>;
	clock-names = "PCLK", "EXTCLK";
};
