* Alphascale asm9260 SoC Real Time Clock

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "alphascale,asm9260-rtc"
- reg: Physical base address of the controller and length
       of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: IRQ line for the RTC.
- clocks: Reference to the clock entry.
- clock-names: should contain:
  * "ahb" for the SoC RTC clock

Example:
rtc0: rtc@800a0000 {
	compatible = "alphascale,asm9260-rtc";
	reg = <0x800a0000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&acc CLKID_AHB_RTC>;
	clock-names = "ahb";
	interrupts = <2>;
};
