Epson RX6110 Real Time Clock
============================

The Epson RX6110 can be used with SPI or I2C busses. The kind of
bus depends on the SPISEL pin and can not be configured via software.

I2C mode
--------

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be: "epson,rx6110"
  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

Example:

	rtc: rtc@32 {
		compatible = "epson,rx6110"
		reg = <0x32>;
	};

SPI mode
--------

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be: "epson,rx6110"
  - reg: chip select number
  - spi-cs-high: RX6110 needs chipselect high
  - spi-cpha: RX6110 works with SPI shifted clock phase
  - spi-cpol: RX6110 works with SPI inverse clock polarity

Example:

	rtc: rtc@3 {
		compatible = "epson,rx6110"
		reg = <3>
		spi-cs-high;
		spi-cpha;
		spi-cpol;
	};
