* Microchip PIC32 Real Time Clock and Calendar

The RTCC keeps time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and one half second. It
provides a calendar in weekday, date, month, and year. It also provides a
configurable alarm.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be: "microchip,pic32mzda-rtc"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- interrupts: RTC alarm/event interrupt
- clocks: clock phandle

Example:

	rtc: rtc@1f8c0000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-rtc";
		reg = <0x1f8c0000 0x60>;
		interrupts = <166 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&PBCLK6>;
	};
