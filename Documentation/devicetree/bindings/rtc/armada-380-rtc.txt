* Real Time Clock of the Armada 38x/7K/8K SoCs

RTC controller for the Armada 38x, 7K and 8K SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-380-rtc" for Armada 38x SoC
	"marvell,armada-8k-rtc" for Aramda 7K/8K SoCs
- reg: a list of base address and size pairs, one for each entry in
  reg-names
- reg names: should contain:
  * "rtc" for the RTC registers
  * "rtc-soc" for the SoC related registers and among them the one
    related to the interrupt.
- interrupts: IRQ line for the RTC.

Example:

rtc@a3800 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-380-rtc";
	reg = <0xa3800 0x20>, <0x184a0 0x0c>;
	reg-names = "rtc", "rtc-soc";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 21 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
