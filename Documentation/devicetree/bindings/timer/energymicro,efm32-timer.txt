* EFM32 timer hardware

The efm32 Giant Gecko SoCs come with four 16 bit timers. Two counters can be
connected to form a 32 bit counter. Each timer has three Compare/Capture
channels and can be used as PWM or Quadrature Decoder. Available clock sources
are the cpu's HFPERCLK (with a 10-bit prescaler) or an external pin.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "energymicro,efm32-timer"
- reg : Address and length of the register set
- clocks : Should contain a reference to the HFPERCLK

Optional properties:
- interrupts : Reference to the timer interrupt

Example:

timer@40010c00 {
	compatible = "energymicro,efm32-timer";
	reg = <0x40010c00 0x400>;
	interrupts = <14>;
	clocks = <&cmu clk_HFPERCLKTIMER3>;
};
