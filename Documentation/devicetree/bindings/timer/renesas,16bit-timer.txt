* Renesas H8/300 16bit timer

The 16bit timer is a 16bit timer/counter with configurable clock inputs and
programmable compare match.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: must contain "renesas,16bit-timer"
  - reg: base address and length of the registers block for the timer module.
  - interrupts: interrupt-specifier for the timer, IMIA
  - clocks: a list of phandle, one for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: must contain "peripheral_clk" for the functional clock.
  - renesas,channel: timer channel number.

Example:

	timer16: timer@ffff68 {
		compatible = "reneas,16bit-timer";
		reg = <0xffff68 8>, <0xffff60 8>;
		interrupts = <24>;
		renesas,channel = <0>;
		clocks = <&pclk>;
		clock-names = "peripheral_clk";
	};
