* Renesas H8/300 8bit timer

The 8bit timer is a 8bit timer/counter with configurable clock inputs and
programmable compare match.

This implement only supported cascade mode.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: must contain "renesas,8bit-timer"
  - reg: base address and length of the registers block for the timer module.
  - interrupts: interrupt-specifier for the timer, CMIA and TOVI
  - clocks: a list of phandle, one for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: must contain "fck" for the functional clock.

Example:

	timer8_0: timer@ffff80 {
		compatible = "renesas,8bit-timer";
		reg = <0xffff80 10>;
		interrupts = <36>;
		clocks = <&fclk>;
		clock-names = "fck";
	};
