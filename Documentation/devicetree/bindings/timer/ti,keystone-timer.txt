* Device tree bindings for Texas instruments Keystone timer

This document provides bindings for the 64-bit timer in the KeyStone
architecture devices. The timer can be configured as a general-purpose 64-bit
timer, dual general-purpose 32-bit timers. When configured as dual 32-bit
timers, each half can operate in conjunction (chain mode) or independently
(unchained mode) of each other.

It is global timer is a free running up-counter and can generate interrupt
when the counter reaches preset counter values.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "ti,keystone-timer".
- reg : specifies base physical address and count of the registers.
- interrupts : interrupt generated by the timer.
- clocks : the clock feeding the timer clock.

Example:

timer@22f0000 {
	compatible = "ti,keystone-timer";
	reg = <0x022f0000 0x80>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 110 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	clocks = <&clktimer15>;
};
