Freescale FlexTimer Module (FTM) Timer

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "fsl,ftm-timer"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets for the
  clock event device and clock source device.
- interrupts : Should be the clock event device interrupt.
- clocks : The clocks provided by the SoC to drive the timer, must contain an
  entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  o "ftm-evt"
  o "ftm-src"
  o "ftm-evt-counter-en"
  o "ftm-src-counter-en"
- big-endian: One boolean property, the big endian mode will be in use if it is
  present, or the little endian mode will be in use for all the device registers.

Example:
ftm: ftm@400b8000 {
	compatible = "fsl,ftm-timer";
	reg = <0x400b8000 0x1000 0x400b9000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-names = "ftm-evt", "ftm-src",
		"ftm-evt-counter-en", "ftm-src-counter-en";
	clocks = <&clks VF610_CLK_FTM2>,
		<&clks VF610_CLK_FTM3>,
		<&clks VF610_CLK_FTM2_EXT_FIX_EN>,
		<&clks VF610_CLK_FTM3_EXT_FIX_EN>;
	big-endian;
};
