* Renesas H8/300 Timer Pulse Unit

The TPU is a 16bit timer/counter with configurable clock inputs and
programmable compare match.
This implementation support only cascade mode.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: must contain "renesas,tpu"
  - reg: base address and length of the registers block in 2 channel.
  - clocks: a list of phandle, one for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: must contain "peripheral_clk" for the functional clock.


Example:
	tpu: tpu@ffffe0 {
		compatible = "renesas,tpu";
		reg = <0xffffe0 16>, <0xfffff0 12>;
		clocks = <&pclk>;
		clock-names = "peripheral_clk";
	};
