Amlogic Meson6 SoCs Timer Controller

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "amlogic,meson6-timer"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : The four interrupts, one for each timer event
- clocks : phandles to the pclk (system clock) and XTAL clocks
- clock-names : must contain "pclk" and "xtal"

Example:

timer@c1109940 {
	compatible = "amlogic,meson6-timer";
	reg = <0xc1109940 0x14>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 10 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <GIC_SPI 29 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	clocks = <&xtal>, <&clk81>;
	clock-names = "xtal", "pclk";
};
