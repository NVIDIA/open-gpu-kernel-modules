NVIDIA Tegra20 timer

The Tegra20 timer provides four 29-bit timer channels and a single 32-bit free
running counter. The first two channels may also trigger a watchdog reset.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "nvidia,tegra20-timer".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : A list of 4 interrupts; one per timer channel.
- clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.

Example:

timer {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-timer";
	reg = <0x60005000 0x60>;
	interrupts = <0 0 0x04
			0 1 0x04
			0 41 0x04
			0 42 0x04>;
	clocks = <&tegra_car 132>;
};
