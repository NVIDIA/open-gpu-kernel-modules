Rockchip IOMMU
==============

A Rockchip DRM iommu translates io virtual addresses to physical addresses for
its master device.  Each slave device is bound to a single master device, and
shares its clocks, power domain and irq.

Required properties:
- compatible      : Should be "rockchip,iommu"
- reg             : Address space for the configuration registers
- interrupts      : Interrupt specifier for the IOMMU instance
- interrupt-names : Interrupt name for the IOMMU instance
- #iommu-cells    : Should be <0>.  This indicates the iommu is a
                    "single-master" device, and needs no additional information
                    to associate with its master device.  See:
                    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt
- clocks          : A list of clocks required for the IOMMU to be accessible by
                    the host CPU.
- clock-names     : Should contain the following:
	"iface" - Main peripheral bus clock (PCLK/HCL) (required)
	"aclk"  - AXI bus clock (required)

Optional properties:
- rockchip,disable-mmu-reset : Don't use the mmu reset operation.
			       Some mmu instances may produce unexpected results
			       when the reset operation is used.

Example:

	vopl_mmu: iommu@ff940300 {
		compatible = "rockchip,iommu";
		reg = <0xff940300 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "vopl_mmu";
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_VOP1>, <&cru HCLK_VOP1>;
		clock-names = "aclk", "iface";
		#iommu-cells = <0>;
	};
