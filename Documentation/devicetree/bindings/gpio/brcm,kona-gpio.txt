Broadcom Kona Family GPIO
=========================

This GPIO driver is used in the following Broadcom SoCs:
  BCM11130, BCM11140, BCM11351, BCM28145, BCM28155

The Broadcom GPIO Controller IP can be configured prior to synthesis to
support up to 8 banks of 32 GPIOs where each bank has its own IRQ. The
GPIO controller only supports edge, not level, triggering of interrupts.

Required properties
-------------------

- compatible: "brcm,bcm11351-gpio", "brcm,kona-gpio"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt outputs from the controller. There is one GPIO
  interrupt per GPIO bank. The number of interrupts listed depends on the
  number of GPIO banks on the SoC. The interrupts must be ordered by bank,
  starting with bank 0. There is always a 1:1 mapping between banks and
  IRQs.
- #gpio-cells: Should be <2>. The first cell is the pin number, the second
  cell is used to specify optional parameters:
  - bit 0 specifies polarity (0 for normal, 1 for inverted)
  See also "gpio-specifier" in .../devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be <2>. The first cell is the GPIO number. The
  second cell is used to specify flags. The following subset of flags is
  supported:
  - trigger type (bits[1:0]):
      1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
      2 = high-to-low edge triggered.
      3 = low-to-high or high-to-low edge triggered
      Valid values are 1, 2, 3
  See also .../devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.

Example:
	gpio: gpio@35003000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm11351-gpio", "brcm,kona-gpio";
		reg = <0x35003000 0x800>;
		interrupts =
		       <GIC_SPI 106 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
			GIC_SPI 115 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
			GIC_SPI 114 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
			GIC_SPI 113 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
			GIC_SPI 112 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
			GIC_SPI 111 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
		interrupt-controller;
	};
