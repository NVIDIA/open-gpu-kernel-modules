* Mediatek Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Host Controller

UFS nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS hardware macro.
Each UFS Host Controller should have its own node.

To bind UFS PHY with UFS host controller, the controller node should
contain a phandle reference to UFS M-PHY node.

Required properties for UFS nodes:
- compatible         : Compatible list, contains the following controller:
                       "mediatek,mt8183-ufshci" for MediaTek UFS host controller
                       present on MT8183 chipsets.
                       "mediatek,mt8192-ufshci" for MediaTek UFS host controller
                       present on MT8192 chipsets.
- reg                : Address and length of the UFS register set.
- phys               : phandle to m-phy.
- clocks             : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs.
- clock-names        : List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
                       order as the clocks property. "ufs" is mandatory.
                       "ufs": ufshci core control clock.
- freq-table-hz      : Array of <min max> operating frequencies stored in the same
                       order as the clocks property. If this property is not
                       defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed
                       that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a
                       fixed rate clock source.
- vcc-supply         : phandle to VCC supply regulator node.

Example:

	ufsphy: phy@11fa0000 {
		...
	};

	ufshci@11270000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-ufshci";
		reg = <0 0x11270000 0 0x2300>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 104 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		phys = <&ufsphy>;

		clocks = <&infracfg_ao INFRACFG_AO_UFS_CG>;
		clock-names = "ufs";
		freq-table-hz = <0 0>;

		vcc-supply = <&mt_pmic_vemc_ldo_reg>;
	};
