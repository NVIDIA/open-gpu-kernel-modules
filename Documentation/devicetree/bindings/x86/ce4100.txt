CE4100 Device Tree Bindings
---------------------------

The CE4100 SoC uses for in core peripherals the following compatible
format: <vendor>,<chip>-<device>.
Many of the "generic" devices like HPET or IO APIC have the ce4100
name in their compatible property because they first appeared in this
SoC.

The CPU nodes
-------------

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "intel,ce4100";
			reg = <0x00>;
		};

		cpu@2 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "intel,ce4100";
			reg = <0x02>;
		};
	};

A "cpu" node describes one logical processor (hardware thread).

Required properties:

- device_type
	Device type, must be "cpu".

- reg
	Local APIC ID, the unique number assigned to each processor by
	system hardware.

The SoC node
------------

This node describes the in-core peripherals. Required property:
  compatible = "intel,ce4100-cp";

The PCI node
------------
This node describes the PCI bus on the SoC. Its property should be
  compatible = "intel,ce4100-pci", "pci";

If the OS is using the IO-APIC for interrupt routing then the reported
interrupt numbers for devices is no longer true. In order to obtain the
correct interrupt number, the child node which represents the device has
to contain the interrupt property. Besides the interrupt property it has
to contain at least the reg property containing the PCI bus address and
compatible property according to "PCI Bus Binding Revision 2.1".
