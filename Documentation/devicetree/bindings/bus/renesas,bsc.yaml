title: Renesas Bus State Controller (BSC)

description: |
  The Renesas Bus State Controller (BSC, sometimes called "LBSC within Bus
  Bridge", or "External Bus Interface") can be found in several Renesas ARM
  SoCs.  It provides an external bus for connecting multiple external
  devices to the SoC, driving several chip select lines, for e.g. NOR
  FLASH, Ethernet and USB.

  While the BSC is a fairly simple memory-mapped bus, it may be part of a
  PM domain, and may have a gateable functional clock.  Before a device
  connected to the BSC can be accessed, the PM domain containing the BSC
  must be powered on, and the functional clock driving the BSC must be
  enabled.

  The bindings for the BSC extend the bindings for "simple-pm-bus".
