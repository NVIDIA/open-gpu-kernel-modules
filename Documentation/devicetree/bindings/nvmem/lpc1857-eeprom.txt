* NXP LPC18xx EEPROM memory NVMEM driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "nxp,lpc1857-eeprom"
  - reg: Must contain an entry with the physical base address and length
    for each entry in reg-names.
  - reg-names: Must include the following entries.
    - reg: EEPROM registers.
    - mem: EEPROM address space.
  - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - clock-names: Must include the following entries.
    - eeprom: EEPROM operating clock.
  - resets: Should contain a reference to the reset controller asserting
    the EEPROM in reset.
  - interrupts: Should contain EEPROM interrupt.

Example:

  eeprom: eeprom@4000e000 {
    compatible = "nxp,lpc1857-eeprom";
    reg = <0x4000e000 0x1000>,
          <0x20040000 0x4000>;
    reg-names = "reg", "mem";
    clocks = <&ccu1 CLK_CPU_EEPROM>;
    clock-names = "eeprom";
    resets = <&rgu 27>;
    interrupts = <4>;
  };
