= Mediatek MTK-EFUSE device tree bindings =

This binding is intended to represent MTK-EFUSE which is found in most Mediatek SOCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be
	      "mediatek,mt7622-efuse", "mediatek,efuse": for MT7622
	      "mediatek,mt7623-efuse", "mediatek,efuse": for MT7623
	      "mediatek,mt8173-efuse" or "mediatek,efuse": for MT8173
	      "mediatek,mt8192-efuse", "mediatek,efuse": for MT8192
	      "mediatek,mt8516-efuse", "mediatek,efuse": for MT8516
- reg: Should contain registers location and length

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of MTK-EFUSE, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	efuse: efuse@10206000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-efuse";
		reg	   = <0 0x10206000 0 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		/* Data cells */
		thermal_calibration: calib@528 {
			reg = <0x528 0xc>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

For example:

	thermal {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&thermal_calibration>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};
