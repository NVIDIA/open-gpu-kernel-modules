Amlogic Meson6/Meson8/Meson8b efuse

Required Properties:
- compatible: depending on the SoC this should be one of:
	- "amlogic,meson6-efuse"
	- "amlogic,meson8-efuse"
	- "amlogic,meson8b-efuse"
- reg: base address and size of the efuse registers
- clocks: a reference to the efuse core gate clock
- clock-names: must be "core"

All properties and sub-nodes as well as the consumer bindings
defined in nvmem.txt in this directory are also supported.


Example:
	efuse: nvmem@0 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8-efuse";
		reg = <0x0 0x2000>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_EFUSE>;
		clock-names = "core";
	};
