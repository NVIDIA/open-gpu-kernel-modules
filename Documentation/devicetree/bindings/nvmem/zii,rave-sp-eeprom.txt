Zodiac Inflight Innovations RAVE EEPROM Bindings

RAVE SP EEPROM device is a "MFD cell" device exposing physical EEPROM
attached to RAVE Supervisory Processor. It is expected that its Device
Tree node is specified as a child of the node corresponding to the
parent RAVE SP device (as documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/zii,rave-sp.txt)

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "zii,rave-sp-eeprom"

Optional properties:

- zii,eeprom-name: Unique EEPROM identifier describing its function in the
  system. Will be used as created NVMEM deivce's name.

Data cells:

Data cells are child nodes of eerpom node, bindings for which are
documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	rave-sp {
		compatible = "zii,rave-sp-rdu1";
		current-speed = <38400>;

		eeprom@a4 {
			compatible = "zii,rave-sp-eeprom";
			reg = <0xa4 0x4000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			zii,eeprom-name = "main-eeprom";

			wdt_timeout: wdt-timeout@81 {
				reg = <0x81 2>;
			};
		};
	}
