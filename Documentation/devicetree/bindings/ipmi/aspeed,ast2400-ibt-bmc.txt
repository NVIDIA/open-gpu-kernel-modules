* Aspeed BT (Block Transfer) IPMI interface

The Aspeed SOCs (AST2400 and AST2500) are commonly used as BMCs
(BaseBoard Management Controllers) and the BT interface can be used to
perform in-band IPMI communication with their host.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of
	"aspeed,ast2400-ibt-bmc"
	"aspeed,ast2500-ibt-bmc"
- reg: physical address and size of the registers

Optional properties:

- interrupts: interrupt generated by the BT interface. without an
  interrupt, the driver will operate in poll mode.

Example:

	ibt@1e789140 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-ibt-bmc";
		reg = <0x1e789140 0x18>;
		interrupts = <8>;
	};
