Microsemi MII Management Controller (MIIM) / MDIO
=================================================

Properties:
- compatible: must be "mscc,ocelot-miim"
- reg: The base address of the MDIO bus controller register bank. Optionally, a
  second register bank can be defined if there is an associated reset register
  for internal PHYs
- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
- #size-cells: Must be <0>.  MDIO addresses have no size component.
- interrupts: interrupt specifier (refer to the interrupt binding)

Typically an MDIO bus might have several children.

Example:
	mdio@107009c {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "mscc,ocelot-miim";
		reg = <0x107009c 0x36>, <0x10700f0 0x8>;
		interrupts = <14>;

		phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
