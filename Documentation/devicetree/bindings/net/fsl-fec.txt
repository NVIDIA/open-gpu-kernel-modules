* Freescale Fast Ethernet Controller (FEC)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-fec"
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain fec interrupt
- phy-mode : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties:
- phy-supply : regulator that powers the Ethernet PHY.
- phy-handle : phandle to the PHY device connected to this device.
- fixed-link : Assume a fixed link. See fixed-link.txt in the same directory.
  Use instead of phy-handle.
- fsl,num-tx-queues : The property is valid for enet-avb IP, which supports
  hw multi queues. Should specify the tx queue number, otherwise set tx queue
  number to 1.
- fsl,num-rx-queues : The property is valid for enet-avb IP, which supports
  hw multi queues. Should specify the rx queue number, otherwise set rx queue
  number to 1.
- fsl,magic-packet : If present, indicates that the hardware supports waking
  up via magic packet.
- fsl,err006687-workaround-present: If present indicates that the system has
  the hardware workaround for ERR006687 applied and does not need a software
  workaround.
- fsl,stop-mode: register bits of stop mode control, the format is
		 <&gpr req_gpr req_bit>.
		 gpr is the phandle to general purpose register node.
		 req_gpr is the gpr register offset for ENET stop request.
		 req_bit is the gpr bit offset for ENET stop request.
 -interrupt-names:  names of the interrupts listed in interrupts property in
  the same order. The defaults if not specified are
  __Number of interrupts__   __Default__
	1			"int0"
	2			"int0", "pps"
	3			"int0", "int1", "int2"
	4			"int0", "int1", "int2", "pps"
  The order may be changed as long as they correspond to the interrupts
  property. Currently, only i.mx7 uses "int1" and "int2". They correspond to
  tx/rx queues 1 and 2. "int0" will be used for queue 0 and ENET_MII interrupts.
  For imx6sx, "int0" handles all 3 queues and ENET_MII. "pps" is for the pulse
  per second interrupt associated with 1588 precision time protocol(PTP).

Optional subnodes:
- mdio : specifies the mdio bus in the FEC, used as a container for phy nodes
  according to phy.txt in the same directory

Deprecated optional properties:
	To avoid these, create a phy node according to phy.txt in the same
	directory, and point the fec's "phy-handle" property to it. Then use
	the phy's reset binding, again described by phy.txt.
- phy-reset-gpios : Should specify the gpio for phy reset
- phy-reset-duration : Reset duration in milliseconds.  Should present
  only if property "phy-reset-gpios" is available.  Missing the property
  will have the duration be 1 millisecond.  Numbers greater than 1000 are
  invalid and 1 millisecond will be used instead.
- phy-reset-active-high : If present then the reset sequence using the GPIO
  specified in the "phy-reset-gpios" property is reversed (H=reset state,
  L=operation state).
- phy-reset-post-delay : Post reset delay in milliseconds. If present then
  a delay of phy-reset-post-delay milliseconds will be observed after the
  phy-reset-gpios has been toggled. Can be omitted thus no delay is
  observed. Delay is in range of 1ms to 1000ms. Other delays are invalid.

Example:

ethernet@83fec000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx51-fec", "fsl,imx27-fec";
	reg = <0x83fec000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <87>;
	phy-mode = "mii";
	phy-reset-gpios = <&gpio2 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* GPIO2_14 */
	local-mac-address = [00 04 9F 01 1B B9];
	phy-supply = <&reg_fec_supply>;
};

Example with phy specified:

ethernet@83fec000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx51-fec", "fsl,imx27-fec";
	reg = <0x83fec000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <87>;
	phy-mode = "mii";
	phy-reset-gpios = <&gpio2 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* GPIO2_14 */
	local-mac-address = [00 04 9F 01 1B B9];
	phy-supply = <&reg_fec_supply>;
	phy-handle = <&ethphy>;
	mdio {
	        clock-frequency = <5000000>;
		ethphy: ethernet-phy@6 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <6>;
			max-speed = <100>;
		};
	};
};
