* MIX Ethernet controller.

Properties:
- compatible: "cavium,octeon-5750-mix"

  Compatibility with all cn5XXX and cn6XXX SOCs populated with MIX
  devices.

- reg: The base addresses of four separate register banks.  The first
  bank contains the MIX registers.  The second bank the corresponding
  AGL registers.  The third bank are the AGL registers shared by all
  MIX devices present.  The fourth bank is the AGL_PRT_CTL shared by
  all MIX devices present.

- cell-index: A single cell specifying which portion of the shared
  register banks corresponds to this MIX device.

- interrupts: Two interrupt specifiers.  The first is the MIX
  interrupt routing and the second the routing for the AGL interrupts.

- phy-handle: Optional, see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

Example:
	ethernet@1070000100800 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-5750-mix";
		reg = <0x10700 0x00100800 0x0 0x100>, /* MIX */
		      <0x11800 0xE0000800 0x0 0x300>, /* AGL */
		      <0x11800 0xE0000400 0x0 0x400>, /* AGL_SHARED  */
		      <0x11800 0xE0002008 0x0 0x8>;   /* AGL_PRT_CTL */
		cell-index = <1>;
		interrupts = <1 18>, < 1 46>;
		local-mac-address = [ 00 0f b7 10 63 54 ];
		phy-handle = <&phy1>;
	};
