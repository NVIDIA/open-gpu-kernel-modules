* Smart Mixed-Signal Connectivity (SMSC) LAN911x/912x Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "smsc,lan<model>", "smsc,lan9115"
- reg : Address and length of the io space for SMSC LAN
- interrupts : one or two interrupt specifiers
  - The first interrupt is the SMSC LAN interrupt line
  - The second interrupt (if present) is the PME (power
    management event) interrupt that is able to wake up the host
     system with a 50ms pulse on network activity
- phy-mode : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties:
- reg-shift : Specify the quantity to shift the register offsets by
- reg-io-width : Specify the size (in bytes) of the IO accesses that
  should be performed on the device.  Valid value for SMSC LAN is
  2 or 4.  If it's omitted or invalid, the size would be 2.
- smsc,irq-active-high : Indicates the IRQ polarity is active-high
- smsc,irq-push-pull : Indicates the IRQ type is push-pull
- smsc,force-internal-phy : Forces SMSC LAN controller to use
  internal PHY
- smsc,force-external-phy : Forces SMSC LAN controller to use
  external PHY
- smsc,save-mac-address : Indicates that mac address needs to be saved
  before resetting the controller
- reset-gpios : a GPIO line connected to the RESET (active low) signal
  of the device. On many systems this is wired high so the device goes
  out of reset at power-on, but if it is under program control, this
  optional GPIO can wake up in response to it.
- vdd33a-supply, vddvario-supply : 3.3V analog and IO logic power supplies

Examples:

lan9220@f4000000 {
	compatible = "smsc,lan9220", "smsc,lan9115";
	reg = <0xf4000000 0x2000000>;
	phy-mode = "mii";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <31>, <32>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio1 30 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	reg-io-width = <4>;
	smsc,irq-push-pull;
};
