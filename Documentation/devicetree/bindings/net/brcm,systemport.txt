* Broadcom BCM7xxx Ethernet Systemport Controller (SYSTEMPORT)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	      "brcm,systemport-v1.00"
	      "brcm,systemportlite-v1.00" or
	      "brcm,systemport"
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupts for the device, first cell must be for the rx
  interrupts, and the second cell should be for the transmit queues. An
  optional third interrupt cell for Wake-on-LAN can be specified
- local-mac-address: Ethernet MAC address (48 bits) of this adapter
- phy-mode: Should be a string describing the PHY interface to the
  Ethernet switch/PHY, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt
- fixed-link: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fixed-link.txt for
  the property specific details

Optional properties:
- systemport,num-tier2-arb: number of tier 2 arbiters, an integer
- systemport,num-tier1-arb: number of tier 1 arbiters, an integer
- systemport,num-txq: number of HW transmit queues, an integer
- systemport,num-rxq: number of HW receive queues, an integer
- clocks: When provided, must be two phandles to the functional clocks nodes of
  the SYSTEMPORT block. The first phandle is the main SYSTEMPORT clock used
  during normal operation, while the second phandle is the Wake-on-LAN clock.
- clock-names: When provided, names of the functional clock phandles, first
  name should be "sw_sysport" and second should be "sw_sysportwol".

Example:
ethernet@f04a0000 {
	compatible = "brcm,systemport-v1.00";
	reg = <0xf04a0000 0x4650>;
	local-mac-address = [ 00 11 22 33 44 55 ];
	fixed-link = <0 1 1000 0 0>;
	phy-mode = "gmii";
	interrupts = <0x0 0x16 0x0>,
		<0x0 0x17 0x0>;
};
