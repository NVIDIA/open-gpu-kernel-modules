* Marvell Armada 380/XP Buffer Manager driver (BM)

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-380-neta-bm".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- clocks: a pointer to the reference clock for this device.
- internal-mem: a phandle to BM internal SRAM definition.

Optional properties (port):

- pool<0 : 3>,capacity: size of external buffer pointers' ring maintained
  in DRAM. Can be set for each pool (id 0 : 3) separately. The value has
  to be chosen between 128 and 16352 and it also has to be aligned to 32.
  Otherwise the driver would adjust a given number or choose default if
  not set.
- pool<0 : 3>,pkt-size: maximum size of a packet accepted by a given buffer
  pointers' pool (id 0 : 3). It will be taken into consideration only when pool
  type is 'short'. For 'long' ones it would be overridden by port's MTU.
  If not set a driver will choose a default value.

In order to see how to hook the BM to a given ethernet port, please
refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/marvell-armada-370-neta.txt.

Example:

- main node:

bm: bm@c8000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-380-neta-bm";
	reg = <0xc8000 0xac>;
	clocks = <&gateclk 13>;
	internal-mem = <&bm_bppi>;
	pool2,capacity = <4096>;
	pool1,pkt-size = <512>;
};

- internal SRAM node:

bm_bppi: bm-bppi {
	compatible = "mmio-sram";
	reg = <MBUS_ID(0x0c, 0x04) 0 0x100000>;
	ranges = <0 MBUS_ID(0x0c, 0x04) 0 0x100000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&gateclk 13>;
};
