* NXP LPC32xx SoC Ethernet Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nxp,lpc-eth"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet controller interrupt

Optional properties:
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory. If the property is
  absent, "rmii" is assumed.
- use-iram: Use LPC32xx internal SRAM (IRAM) for DMA buffering

Optional subnodes:
- mdio : specifies the mdio bus, used as a container for phy nodes according to
  phy.txt in the same directory


Example:

	mac: ethernet@31060000 {
		compatible = "nxp,lpc-eth";
		reg = <0x31060000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
		interrupts = <29 0>;

		phy-mode = "rmii";
		use-iram;
	};
