* AMD 10GbE driver (amd-xgbe)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "amd,xgbe-seattle-v1a"
- reg: Address and length of the register sets for the device
   - MAC registers
   - PCS registers
   - SerDes Rx/Tx registers
   - SerDes integration registers (1/2)
   - SerDes integration registers (2/2)
- interrupts: Should contain the amd-xgbe interrupt(s). The first interrupt
  listed is required and is the general device interrupt. If the optional
  amd,per-channel-interrupt property is specified, then one additional
  interrupt for each DMA channel supported by the device should be specified.
  The last interrupt listed should be the PCS auto-negotiation interrupt.
- clocks:
   - DMA clock for the amd-xgbe device (used for calculating the
     correct Rx interrupt watchdog timer value on a DMA channel
     for coalescing)
   - PTP clock for the amd-xgbe device
- clock-names: Should be the names of the clocks
   - "dma_clk" for the DMA clock
   - "ptp_clk" for the PTP clock
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent
- amd,per-channel-interrupt: Indicates that Rx and Tx complete will generate
  a unique interrupt for each DMA channel - this requires an additional
  interrupt be configured for each DMA channel
- amd,speed-set: Speed capabilities of the device
    0 - 1GbE and 10GbE (default)
    1 - 2.5GbE and 10GbE

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties defined in
ethernet.txt.

The following optional properties are represented by an array with each
value corresponding to a particular speed. The first array value represents
the setting for the 1GbE speed, the second value for the 2.5GbE speed and
the third value for the 10GbE speed.  All three values are required if the
property is used.
- amd,serdes-blwc: Baseline wandering correction enablement
    0 - Off
    1 - On
- amd,serdes-cdr-rate: CDR rate speed selection
- amd,serdes-pq-skew: PQ (data sampling) skew
- amd,serdes-tx-amp: TX amplitude boost
- amd,serdes-dfe-tap-config: DFE taps available to run
- amd,serdes-dfe-tap-enable: DFE taps to enable
