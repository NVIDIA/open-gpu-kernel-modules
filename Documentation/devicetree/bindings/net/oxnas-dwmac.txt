* Oxford Semiconductor OXNAS DWMAC Ethernet controller

The device inherits all the properties of the dwmac/stmmac devices
described in the file stmmac.txt in the current directory with the
following changes.

Required properties on all platforms:

- compatible:	For the OX820 SoC, it should be :
		- "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac" to select glue
		- "snps,dwmac-3.512" to select IP version.

- clocks: Should contain phandles to the following clocks
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
		- "stmmaceth" for the host clock - see stmmac.txt
		- "gmac" for the peripheral gate clock

- oxsemi,sys-ctrl: a phandle to the system controller syscon node

Example :

etha: ethernet@40400000 {
	compatible = "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac", "snps,dwmac-3.512";
	reg = <0x40400000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 17 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
	mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
	phy-mode = "rgmii";

	clocks = <&stdclk CLK_820_ETHA>, <&gmacclk>;
	clock-names = "gmac", "stmmaceth";
	resets = <&reset RESET_MAC>;

	/* Regmap for sys registers */
	oxsemi,sys-ctrl = <&sys>;

};
