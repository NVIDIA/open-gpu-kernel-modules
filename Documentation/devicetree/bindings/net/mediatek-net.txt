MediaTek Frame Engine Ethernet controller
=========================================

The frame engine ethernet controller can be found on MediaTek SoCs. These SoCs
have dual GMAC each represented by a child node..

* Ethernet controller node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
		"mediatek,mt2701-eth": for MT2701 SoC
		"mediatek,mt7623-eth", "mediatek,mt2701-eth": for MT7623 SoC
		"mediatek,mt7622-eth": for MT7622 SoC
		"mediatek,mt7629-eth": for MT7629 SoC
		"ralink,rt5350-eth": for Ralink Rt5350F and MT7628/88 SoC
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the three frame engines interrupts in numeric
	order. These are fe_int0, fe_int1 and fe_int2.
- clocks: the clock used by the core
- clock-names: the names of the clock listed in the clocks property. These are
	"ethif", "esw", "gp2", "gp1" : For MT2701 and MT7623 SoC
        "ethif", "esw", "gp0", "gp1", "gp2", "sgmii_tx250m", "sgmii_rx250m",
	"sgmii_cdr_ref", "sgmii_cdr_fb", "sgmii_ck", "eth2pll" : For MT7622 SoC
	"ethif", "sgmiitop", "esw", "gp0", "gp1", "gp2", "fe", "sgmii_tx250m",
	"sgmii_rx250m", "sgmii_cdr_ref", "sgmii_cdr_fb", "sgmii2_tx250m",
	"sgmii2_rx250m", "sgmii2_cdr_ref", "sgmii2_cdr_fb", "sgmii_ck",
	"eth2pll" : For MT7629 SoC.
- power-domains: phandle to the power domain that the ethernet is part of
- resets: Should contain phandles to the ethsys reset signals
- reset-names: Should contain the names of reset signal listed in the resets
		property
		These are "fe", "gmac" and "ppe"
- mediatek,ethsys: phandle to the syscon node that handles the port setup
- mediatek,infracfg: phandle to the syscon node that handles the path from
	GMAC to PHY variants, which is required for MT7629 SoC.
- mediatek,sgmiisys: a list of phandles to the syscon node that handles the
	SGMII setup which is required for those SoCs equipped with SGMII such
	as MT7622 and MT7629 SoC. And MT7622 have only one set of SGMII shared
	by GMAC1 and GMAC2; MT7629 have two independent sets of SGMII directed
	to GMAC1 and GMAC2, respectively.
- mediatek,pctl: phandle to the syscon node that handles the ports slew rate
	and driver current: only for MT2701 and MT7623 SoC

* Ethernet MAC node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,eth-mac"
- reg: The number of the MAC
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory and
	the phy-mode "trgmii" required being provided when reg
	is equal to 0 and the MAC uses fixed-link to connect
	with internal switch such as MT7530.

Example:

eth: ethernet@1b100000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-eth";
	reg = <0 0x1b100000 0 0x20000>;
	clocks = <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHIF_SEL>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_ESW>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_GP2>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_GP1>;
	clock-names = "ethif", "esw", "gp2", "gp1";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 200 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW
		      GIC_SPI 199 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW
		      GIC_SPI 198 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	power-domains = <&scpsys MT2701_POWER_DOMAIN_ETH>;
	resets = <&ethsys MT2701_ETHSYS_ETH_RST>;
	reset-names = "eth";
	mediatek,ethsys = <&ethsys>;
	mediatek,pctl = <&syscfg_pctl_a>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	gmac1: mac@0 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <0>;
		phy-handle = <&phy0>;
	};

	gmac2: mac@1 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <1>;
		phy-handle = <&phy1>;
	};

	mdio-bus {
		phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			phy-mode = "rgmii";
		};

		phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			phy-mode = "rgmii";
		};
	};
};
