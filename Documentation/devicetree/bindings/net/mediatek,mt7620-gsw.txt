Mediatek Gigabit Switch
=======================

The mediatek gigabit switch can be found on Mediatek SoCs (mt7620, mt7621).

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,mt7620-gsw" or "mediatek,mt7621-gsw"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the gigabit switches interrupt
- resets: Should contain the gigabit switches resets
- reset-names: Should contain the reset names "gsw"

Example:

gsw@10110000 {
	compatible = "ralink,mt7620-gsw";
	reg = <0x10110000 8000>;

	resets = <&rstctrl 23>;
	reset-names = "gsw";

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <17>;
};
