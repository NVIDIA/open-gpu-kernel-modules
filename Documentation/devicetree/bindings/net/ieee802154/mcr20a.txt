* MCR20A IEEE 802.15.4 *

Required properties:
  - compatible:		should be "nxp,mcr20a"
  - spi-max-frequency:	maximal bus speed, should be set to a frequency
			lower than 9000000 depends sync or async operation mode
  - reg:		the chipselect index
  - interrupts:		the interrupt generated by the device. Non high-level
			can occur deadlocks while handling isr.

Optional properties:
  - rst_b-gpio:		GPIO spec for the RST_B pin

Example:

	mcr20a@0 {
		compatible = "nxp,mcr20a";
		spi-max-frequency = <9000000>;
		reg = <0>;
		interrupts = <17 2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		rst_b-gpio = <&gpio 27 1>
	};
