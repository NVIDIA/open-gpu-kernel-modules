* MRF24J40 IEEE 802.15.4 *

Required properties:
  - compatible:		should be "microchip,mrf24j40", "microchip,mrf24j40ma",
			or "microchip,mrf24j40mc" depends on your transceiver
			board
  - spi-max-frequency:	maximal bus speed, should be set something under or equal
			10000000
  - reg:		the chipselect index
  - interrupts:		the interrupt generated by the device.

Example:

	mrf24j40ma@0 {
		compatible = "microchip,mrf24j40ma";
		spi-max-frequency = <8500000>;
		reg = <0>;
		interrupts = <19 8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
	};
