description:
  This binding represents Ethernet Switches which have a dedicated CPU
  port. That port is usually connected to an Ethernet Controller of the
  SoC. Such setups are typical for embedded devices.

      A two element list indicates which DSA cluster, and position within the
      cluster a switch takes. <0 0> is cluster 0, switch 0. <0 1> is cluster 0,
      switch 1. <1 0> is cluster 1, switch 0. A switch not part of any cluster
      (single device hanging off a CPU port) must not specify this property

              Should be a list of phandles to other switch's DSA port. This
              port is used as the outgoing port towards the phandle ports. The
              full routing information must be given, not just the one hop
              routes to neighbouring switches

              device is what the switch port is connected to

              Instead of the default, the switch will use this tag protocol if
              possible. Useful when a device supports multiple protcols and
              the default is incompatible with the Ethernet device.
