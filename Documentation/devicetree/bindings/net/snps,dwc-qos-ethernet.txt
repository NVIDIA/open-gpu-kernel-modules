* Synopsys DWC Ethernet QoS IP version 4.10 driver (GMAC)

This binding is deprecated, but it continues to be supported, but new
features should be preferably added to the stmmac binding document.

This binding supports the Synopsys Designware Ethernet QoS (Quality Of Service)
IP block. The IP supports multiple options for bus type, clocking and reset
structure, and feature list. Consequently, a number of properties and list
entries in properties are marked as optional, or only required in specific HW
configurations.

Required properties:
- compatible: One of:
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    Represents the IP core when integrated into the Axis ARTPEC-6 SoC.
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    Represents the IP core when integrated into the NVIDIA Tegra186 SoC.
  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10"
    This combination is deprecated. It should be treated as equivalent to
    "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10". It is supported to be
    compatible with earlier revisions of this binding.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifiers for each entry in clock-names, in the
  same order. See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
  configuration, in any order:
  - "tx"
    The EQOS transmit path clock. The HW signal name is clk_tx_i.
    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock also drives the PHY TX
    path. In other configurations, other clocks (such as tx_125, rmii) may
    drive the PHY TX path.
  - "rx"
    The EQOS receive path clock. The HW signal name is clk_rx_i.
    In some configurations (e.g. GMII/RGMII), this clock is derived from the
    PHY's RX clock output. In other configurations, other clocks (such as
    rx_125, rmii) may drive the EQOS RX path.
    In cases where the PHY clock is directly fed into the EQOS receive path
    without intervening logic, the DT need not represent this clock, since it
    is assumed to be fully under the control of the PHY device/driver. In
    cases where SoC integration adds additional logic to this path, such as a
    SW-controlled clock gate, this clock should be represented in DT.
  - "slave_bus"
    The CPU/slave-bus (CSR) interface clock. This applies to any bus type;
    APB, AHB, AXI, etc. The HW signal name is hclk_i (AHB) or clk_csr_i (other
    buses).
  - "master_bus"
    The master bus interface clock. Only required in configurations that use a
    separate clock for the master and slave bus interfaces. The HW signal name
    is hclk_i (AHB) or aclk_i (AXI).
  - "ptp_ref"
    The PTP reference clock. The HW signal name is clk_ptp_ref_i.
  - "phy_ref_clk"
    This clock is deprecated and should not be used by new compatible values.
    It is equivalent to "tx".
  - "apb_pclk"
    This clock is deprecated and should not be used by new compatible values.
    It is equivalent to "slave_bus".

  Note: Support for additional IP configurations may require adding the
  following clocks to this list in the future: clk_rx_125_i, clk_tx_125_i,
  clk_pmarx_0_i, clk_pmarx1_i, clk_rmii_i, clk_revmii_rx_i, clk_revmii_tx_i.
  Configurations exist where multiple similar clocks are used at once, e.g. all
  of clk_rx_125_i, clk_pmarx_0_i, clk_pmarx1_i. For this reason it is best to
  extend the binding with a separate clock-names entry for each of those RX
  clocks, rather than repurposing the existing "rx" clock-names entry as a
  generic/logical clock in a similar fashion to "master_bus" and "slave_bus".
  This will allow easy support for configurations that support multiple PHY
  interfaces using a mux, and hence need to have explicit control over
  specific RX clocks.

  The following compatible values require the following set of clocks:
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "slave_bus"
    - "master_bus"
    - "rx"
    - "tx"
    - "ptp_ref"
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "slave_bus"
    - "master_bus"
    - "tx"
    - "ptp_ref"
  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10" (deprecated):
    - "phy_ref_clk"
    - "apb_clk"
- interrupts: Should contain the core's combined interrupt signal
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- resets: Phandle and reset specifiers for each entry in reset-names, in the
  same order. See ../reset/reset.txt.
- reset-names: May contain any/all of the following depending on the IP
  configuration, in any order:
  - "eqos". The reset to the entire module. The HW signal name is hreset_n
    (AHB) or aresetn_i (AXI).

  The following compatible values require the following set of resets:
  (the reset properties may be omitted if empty)
  - "nvidia,tegra186-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - "eqos".
  - "axis,artpec6-eqos", "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10":
    - None.
  - "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-4.10" (deprecated):
    - None.

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent
- phy-reset-gpios: Phandle and specifier for any GPIO used to reset the PHY.
  See ../gpio/gpio.txt.
- snps,en-lpi: If present it enables use of the AXI low-power interface
- snps,write-requests: Number of write requests that the AXI port can issue.
  It depends on the SoC configuration.
- snps,read-requests: Number of read requests that the AXI port can issue.
  It depends on the SoC configuration.
- snps,burst-map: Bitmap of allowed AXI burst lengts, with the LSB
  representing 4, then 8 etc.
- snps,txpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the TX DMA
- snps,rxpbl: DMA Programmable burst length for the RX DMA
- snps,en-tx-lpi-clockgating: Enable gating of the MAC TX clock during
  TX low-power mode.
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- mdio device tree subnode: When the GMAC has a phy connected to its local
    mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
    required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "snps,dwc-qos-ethernet-mdio".
    - #address-cells: Must be <1>.
    - #size-cells: Must be <0>.

    For each phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
    fields:

    - reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
    - device_type: Must be "ethernet-phy".
    - fixed-mode device tree subnode: see fixed-link.txt in the same directory

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
defined in ethernet.txt.
