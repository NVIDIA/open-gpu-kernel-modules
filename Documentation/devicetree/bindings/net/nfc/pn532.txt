* NXP Semiconductors PN532 NFC Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
    - "nxp,pn532" Place a node with this inside the devicetree node of the bus
                  where the NFC chip is connected to.
                  Currently the kernel has phy bindings for uart and i2c.
    - "nxp,pn532-i2c" (DEPRECATED) only works for the i2c binding.
    - "nxp,pn533-i2c" (DEPRECATED) only works for the i2c binding.

Required properties if connected on i2c:
- clock-frequency: I²C work frequency.
- reg: for the I²C bus address. This is fixed at 0x24 for the PN532.
- interrupts: GPIO interrupt to which the chip is connected

Optional SoC Specific Properties:
- pinctrl-names: Contains only one value - "default".
- pintctrl-0: Specifies the pin control groups used for this controller.

Example (for ARM-based BeagleBone with PN532 on I2C2):

&i2c2 {


	pn532: nfc@24 {

		compatible = "nxp,pn532";

		reg = <0x24>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;

	};
};

Example (for PN532 connected via uart):

uart4: serial@49042000 {
        compatible = "ti,omap3-uart";

        pn532: nfc {
                compatible = "nxp,pn532";
        };
};
