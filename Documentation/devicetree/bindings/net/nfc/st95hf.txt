* STMicroelectronics : NFC Transceiver ST95HF

ST NFC Transceiver is required to attach with SPI bus.
ST95HF node should be defined in DT as SPI slave device of SPI
master with which ST95HF transceiver is physically connected.
The properties defined below are required to be the part of DT
to include ST95HF transceiver into the platform.

Required properties:
===================
- reg: Address of SPI slave "ST95HF transceiver" on SPI master bus.

- compatible: should be "st,st95hf" for ST95HF NFC transceiver

- spi-max-frequency: Max. operating SPI frequency for ST95HF
	transceiver.

- enable-gpio: GPIO line to enable ST95HF transceiver.

- interrupts : Standard way to define ST95HF transceiver's out
	interrupt.

Optional property:
=================
- st95hfvin-supply : This is an optional property. It contains a
	phandle to ST95HF transceiver's regulator supply node in DT.

Example:
=======
spi@9840000 {
	reg = <0x9840000 0x110>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	cs-gpios = <&pio0 4>;

	st95hf@0{
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "st,st95hf";
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		enable-gpio = <&pio4 0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pio0>;
		interrupts = <7 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	};

};
