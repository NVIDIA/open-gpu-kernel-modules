Hisilicon hip04 Ethernet Controller

* Ethernet controller node

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "hisilicon,hip04-mac".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device.
- port-handle: <phandle port channel>
	phandle, specifies a reference to the syscon ppe node
	port, port number connected to the controller
	channel, recv channel start from channel * number (RX_DESC_NUM)
	group, field in the pkg desc, in general, it is the same as the port.
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt [1].

Optional properties:
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt [1].

* Ethernet ppe node:
Control rx & tx fifos of all ethernet controllers.
Have 2048 recv channels shared by all ethernet controllers, only if no overlap.
Each controller's recv channel start from channel * number (RX_DESC_NUM).

Required properties:
- compatible: "hisilicon,hip04-ppe", "syscon".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.


* MDIO bus node:

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "hisilicon,mdio".
- Inherits from MDIO bus node binding [2]

Example:
	mdio {
		compatible = "hisilicon,mdio";
		reg = <0x28f1000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <0>;
			marvell,reg-init = <18 0x14 0 0x8001>;
		};

		phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <1>;
			marvell,reg-init = <18 0x14 0 0x8001>;
		};
	};
