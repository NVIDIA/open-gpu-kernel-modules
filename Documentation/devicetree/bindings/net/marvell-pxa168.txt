* Marvell PXA168 Ethernet Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,pxa168-eth".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device.
- clocks: pointer to the clock for the device.

Optional properties:
- port-id: Ethernet port number. Should be '0','1' or '2'.
- #address-cells: must be 1 when using sub-nodes.
- #size-cells: must be 0 when using sub-nodes.
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
defined in ethernet.txt.

Sub-nodes:
Each PHY can be represented as a sub-node. This is not mandatory.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the MDIO address of the PHY.

Example:

	eth0: ethernet@f7b90000 {
		compatible = "marvell,pxa168-eth";
		reg = <0xf7b90000 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&chip CLKID_GETH0>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		phy-handle = <&ethphy0>;

		ethphy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
