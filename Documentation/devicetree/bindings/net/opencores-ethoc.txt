* OpenCores MAC 10/100 Mbps

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "opencores,ethoc".
- reg: two memory regions (address and length),
  first region is for the device registers and descriptor rings,
  second is for the device packet memory.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device.

Optional properties:
- clocks: phandle to refer to the clk used as per
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Examples:

	enet0: ethoc@fd030000 {
		compatible = "opencores,ethoc";
		reg = <0xfd030000 0x4000 0xfd800000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <1>;
		local-mac-address = [00 50 c2 13 6f 00];
		clocks = <&osc>;
        };
