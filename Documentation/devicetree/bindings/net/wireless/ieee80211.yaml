    description:
      List of supported frequency ranges in KHz. This can be used for devices
      that in a given config support less channels than normally. It may happen
      chipset supports a wide wireless band but it is limited to some part of
      it due to used antennas or power amplifier. An example case for this
      can be tri-band wireless router with two identical chipsets used for two
      different 5 GHz subbands. Using them incorrectly could not work or
      decrease performance noticeably
