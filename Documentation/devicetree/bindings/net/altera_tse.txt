* Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet MAC driver (TSE)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "altr,tse-1.0" for legacy SGDMA based TSE, and should
		be "altr,tse-msgdma-1.0" for the preferred MSGDMA based TSE.
		ALTR is supported for legacy device trees, but is deprecated.
		altr should be used for all new designs.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  "control_port": MAC configuration space region
  "tx_csr":       xDMA Tx dispatcher control and status space region
  "tx_desc":      MSGDMA Tx dispatcher descriptor space region
  "rx_csr" :      xDMA Rx dispatcher control and status space region
  "rx_desc":      MSGDMA Rx dispatcher descriptor space region
  "rx_resp":      MSGDMA Rx dispatcher response space region
  "s1":		  SGDMA descriptor memory
- interrupts: Should contain the TSE interrupts and it's mode.
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names
  "rx_irq":       xDMA Rx dispatcher interrupt
  "tx_irq":       xDMA Tx dispatcher interrupt
- rx-fifo-depth: MAC receive FIFO buffer depth in bytes
- tx-fifo-depth: MAC transmit FIFO buffer depth in bytes
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
- phy-addr: See ethernet.txt in the same directory. A configuration should
		include phy-handle or phy-addr.
- altr,has-supplementary-unicast:
		If present, TSE supports additional unicast addresses.
		Otherwise additional unicast addresses are not supported.
- altr,has-hash-multicast-filter:
		If present, TSE supports a hash based multicast filter.
		Otherwise, hash-based multicast filtering is not supported.

- mdio device tree subnode: When the TSE has a phy connected to its local
		mdio, there must be device tree subnode with the following
		required properties:

	- compatible: Must be "altr,tse-mdio".
	- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
	- #size-cells: Must be <0>.

	For each phy on the mdio bus, there must be a node with the following
	fields:

	- reg: phy id used to communicate to phy.
	- device_type: Must be "ethernet-phy".

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties defined in
ethernet.txt.
