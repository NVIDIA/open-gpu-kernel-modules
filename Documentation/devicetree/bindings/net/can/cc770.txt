Memory mapped Bosch CC770 and Intel AN82527 CAN controller

Note: The CC770 is a CAN controller from Bosch, which is 100%
compatible with the old AN82527 from Intel, but with "bugs" being fixed.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "bosch,cc770" for the CC770 and "intc,82527"
	for the AN82527.

- reg : should specify the chip select, address offset and size required
	to map the registers of the controller. The size is usually 0x80.

- interrupts : property with a value describing the interrupt source
	(number and sensitivity) required for the controller.

Optional properties:

- bosch,external-clock-frequency : frequency of the external oscillator
	clock in Hz. Note that the internal clock frequency used by the
	controller is half of that value. If not specified, a default
	value of 16000000 (16 MHz) is used.

- bosch,clock-out-frequency : slock frequency in Hz on the CLKOUT pin.
	If not specified or if the specified value is 0, the CLKOUT pin
	will be disabled.

- bosch,slew-rate : slew rate of the CLKOUT signal. If not specified,
	a resonable value will be calculated.

- bosch,disconnect-rx0-input : see data sheet.

- bosch,disconnect-rx1-input : see data sheet.

- bosch,disconnect-tx1-output : see data sheet.

- bosch,polarity-dominant : see data sheet.

- bosch,divide-memory-clock : see data sheet.

- bosch,iso-low-speed-mux : see data sheet.

For further information, please have a look to the CC770 or AN82527.

Examples:

can@3,100 {
	compatible = "bosch,cc770";
	reg = <3 0x100 0x80>;
	interrupts = <2 0>;
	interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
	bosch,external-clock-frequency = <16000000>;
};
