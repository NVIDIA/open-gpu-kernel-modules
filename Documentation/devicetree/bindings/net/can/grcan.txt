Aeroflex Gaisler GRCAN and GRHCAN CAN controllers.

The GRCAN and CRHCAN CAN controllers are available in the GRLIB VHDL IP core
library.

Note: These properties are built from the AMBA plug&play in a Leon SPARC system
(the ordinary environment for GRCAN and GRHCAN). There are no dts files for
sparc.

Required properties:

- name : Should be "GAISLER_GRCAN", "01_03d", "GAISLER_GRHCAN" or "01_034"

- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device

- freq : Frequency of the external oscillator clock in Hz (the frequency of
	the amba bus in the ordinary case)

- interrupts : Interrupt number for this device

Optional properties:

- systemid : If not present or if the value of the least significant 16 bits
	of this 32-bit property is smaller than GRCAN_TXBUG_SAFE_GRLIB_VERSION
	a bug workaround is activated.
