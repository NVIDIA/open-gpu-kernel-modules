* Microchip MCP251X stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following:
   - "microchip,mcp2510" for MCP2510.
   - "microchip,mcp2515" for MCP2515.
   - "microchip,mcp25625" for MCP25625.
 - reg: SPI chip select.
 - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
 - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.

Optional properties:
 - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
 - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.
 - gpio-controller: Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and
                the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity.

Example:
	can0: can@1 {
		compatible = "microchip,mcp2515";
		reg = <1>;
		clocks = <&clk24m>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio4>;
		interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};
