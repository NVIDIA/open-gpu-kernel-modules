	      When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	      SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	      followed by the generic version.

- reg: physical base address and size of the R-Car CAN register map.
- interrupts: interrupt specifier for the sole interrupt.
- clocks: phandles and clock specifiers for 3 CAN clock inputs.
- clock-names: 3 clock input name strings: "clkp1", "clkp2", and "can_clk".
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: must be "default".

Required properties for R8A774A1, R8A774B1, R8A774C0, R8A774E1, R8A7795,
R8A77960, R8A77961, R8A77965, R8A77990, and R8A77995:
For the denoted SoCs, "clkp2" can be CANFD clock. This is a div6 clock and can
be used by both CAN and CAN FD controller at the same time. It needs to be
scaled to maximum frequency if any of these controllers use it. This is done
using the below properties:

- assigned-clocks: phandle of clkp2(CANFD) clock.
- assigned-clock-rates: maximum frequency of this clock.

Optional properties:
- renesas,can-clock-select: R-Car CAN Clock Source Select. Valid values are:
			    <0x0> (default) : Peripheral clock (clkp1)
			    <0x1> : Peripheral clock (clkp2)
			    <0x3> : External input clock

Example
-------

SoC common .dtsi file:

	can0: can@e6e80000 {
		compatible = "renesas,can-r8a7791", "renesas,rcar-gen2-can";
		reg = <0 0xe6e80000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 186 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp9_clks R8A7791_CLK_RCAN0>,
			 <&cpg_clocks R8A7791_CLK_RCAN>, <&can_clk>;
		clock-names = "clkp1", "clkp2", "can_clk";
		status = "disabled";
	};

Board specific .dts file:

&can0 {
	pinctrl-0 = <&can0_pins>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	status = "okay";
};
