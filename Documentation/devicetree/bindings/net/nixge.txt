* NI XGE Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ni,xge-enet-3.00", but can be "ni,xge-enet-2.00" for
              older device trees with DMA engines co-located in the address map,
              with the one reg entry to describe the whole device.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains the
       information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names.
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
	"dma":  DMA engine control and status region
        "ctrl": MDIO and PHY control and status region
- interrupts: Should contain tx and rx interrupt
- interrupt-names: Should be "rx" and "tx"
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- nvmem-cells: Phandle of nvmem cell containing the MAC address
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be "address"

Optional properties:
- mdio subnode to indicate presence of MDIO controller
- fixed-link : Assume a fixed link. See fixed-link.txt in the same directory.
  Use instead of phy-handle.
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

Examples (10G generic PHY):
	nixge0: ethernet@40000000 {
		compatible = "ni,xge-enet-3.00";
		reg = <0x40000000 0x4000
		       0x41002000 0x2000>;
		reg-names = "dma", "ctrl";

		nvmem-cells = <&eth1_addr>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "address";

		interrupts = <0 29 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, <0 30 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;

		phy-mode = "xgmii";
		phy-handle = <&ethernet_phy1>;

		mdio {
			ethernet_phy1: ethernet-phy@4 {
				compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45";
				reg = <4>;
			};
		};
	};

Examples (10G generic PHY, no MDIO):
	nixge0: ethernet@40000000 {
		compatible = "ni,xge-enet-2.00";
		reg = <0x40000000 0x6000>;

		nvmem-cells = <&eth1_addr>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "address";

		interrupts = <0 29 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, <0 30 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;

		phy-mode = "xgmii";
		phy-handle = <&ethernet_phy1>;
	};

Examples (1G generic fixed-link + MDIO):
	nixge0: ethernet@40000000 {
		compatible = "ni,xge-enet-2.00";
		reg = <0x40000000 0x6000>;

		nvmem-cells = <&eth1_addr>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "address";

		interrupts = <0 29 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, <0 30 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;

		phy-mode = "xgmii";

		fixed-link {
			speed = <1000>;
			pause;
			link-gpios = <&gpio0 63 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		};

		mdio {
			ethernet_phy1: ethernet-phy@4 {
				compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
				reg = <4>;
			};
		};

	};
