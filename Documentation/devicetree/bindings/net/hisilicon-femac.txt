Hisilicon Fast Ethernet MAC controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain one of the following version strings:
	* "hisilicon,hisi-femac-v1"
	* "hisilicon,hisi-femac-v2"
	and the soc string "hisilicon,hi3516cv300-femac".
- reg: specifies base physical address(s) and size of the device registers.
  The first region is the MAC core register base and size.
  The second region is the global MAC control register.
- interrupts: should contain the MAC interrupt.
- clocks: A phandle to the MAC main clock.
- resets: should contain the phandle to the MAC reset signal(required) and
	the PHY reset signal(optional).
- reset-names: should contain the reset signal name "mac"(required)
	and "phy"(optional).
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt [1].
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt [1].
- hisilicon,phy-reset-delays-us: triplet of delays if PHY reset signal given.
	The 1st cell is reset pre-delay in micro seconds.
	The 2nd cell is reset pulse in micro seconds.
	The 3rd cell is reset post-delay in micro seconds.

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
defined in ethernet.txt[1].

Example:
	hisi_femac: ethernet@10090000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3516cv300-femac","hisilicon,hisi-femac-v2";
		reg = <0x10090000 0x1000>,<0x10091300 0x200>;
		interrupts = <12>;
		clocks = <&crg HI3518EV200_ETH_CLK>;
		resets = <&crg 0xec 0>,<&crg 0xec 3>;
		reset-names = "mac","phy";
		mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		phy-mode = "mii";
		phy-handle = <&phy0>;
		hisilicon,phy-reset-delays-us = <10000 20000 20000>;
	};
