title: Qualcomm IP Accelerator (IPA)

description:
  This binding describes the Qualcomm IPA.  The IPA is capable of offloading
  certain network processing tasks (e.g. filtering, routing, and NAT) from
  the main processor.

  The IPA sits between multiple independent "execution environments,"
  including the Application Processor (AP) and the modem.  The IPA presents
  a Generic Software Interface (GSI) to each execution environment.
  The GSI is an integral part of the IPA, but it is logically isolated
  and has a distinct interrupt and a separately-defined address space.

  See also soc/qcom/qcom,smp2p.txt and interconnect/interconnect.txt.  See
  iommu/iommu.txt and iommu/arm,smmu.yaml for more information about SMMU
  bindings.
