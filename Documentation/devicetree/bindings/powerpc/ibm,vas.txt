* IBM Powerpc Virtual Accelerator Switchboard (VAS)

VAS is a hardware mechanism that allows kernel subsystems and user processes
to directly submit compression and other requests to Nest accelerators (NX)
or other coprocessors functions.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "ibm,vas".
- ibm,vas-id : A unique identifier for each instance of VAS in the system
- reg : Should contain 4 pairs of 64-bit fields specifying the Hypervisor
  window context start and length, OS/User window context start and length,
  "Paste address" start and length, "Paste window id" start bit and number
  of bits)

Example:

	vas@6019100000000 {
		compatible = "ibm,vas", "ibm,power9-vas";
		reg = <0x6019100000000 0x2000000 0x6019000000000 0x100000000 0x8000000000000 0x100000000 0x20 0x10>;
		name = "vas";
		ibm,vas-id = <0x1>;
	};
