	Definition: Must include "fsl,dcsr" and "simple-bus".
	The DCSR space exists in the memory-mapped bus.

	- #address-cells
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: A standard property.  Defines the number of cells
	or representing physical addresses in child nodes.

	- #size-cells
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: A standard property.  Defines the number of cells
	or representing the size of physical addresses in
	child nodes.

	- ranges
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>

Event Processing Unit

This node represents the region of DCSR space allocated to the EPU

PROPERTIES

	- compatible
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must include "fsl,dcsr-epu"

	- interrupts
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
	Definition:  Specifies the interrupts generated by the EPU.
	The value of the interrupts property consists of three
	interrupt specifiers. The format of the specifier is defined
	by the binding document describing the node's interrupt parent.

	The EPU counters can be configured to assert the performance
	monitor interrupt signal based on either counter overflow or value
	match. Which counter asserted the interrupt is captured in an EPU
	Counter Interrupt Status Register (EPCPUISR).

	The EPU unit can also be configured to assert either or both of
	two interrupt signals based on debug event sources within the SoC.
	The interrupt signals are epu_xt_int0 and epu_xt_int1.
	Which event source asserted the interrupt is captured in an EPU
	Interrupt Status Register (EPISR0,EPISR1).

	Interrupt numbers are listed in order (perfmon, event0, event1).

	- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the physical address
	offset and length of the DCSR space registers of the device
	configuration block.

	or to a DDR based trace buffer. In some configurations the NPC trace
	buffer can be the only trace buffer used.
