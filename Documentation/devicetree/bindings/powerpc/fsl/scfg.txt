Freescale Supplement configuration unit (SCFG)

SCFG is the supplemental configuration unit, that provides SoC specific
configuration and status registers for the chip. Such as getting PEX port
status.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "fsl,<chip>-scfg"
- reg: should contain base address and length of SCFG memory-mapped
registers

Example:

	scfg: global-utilities@fc000 {
		compatible = "fsl,t1040-scfg";
		reg = <0xfc000 0x1000>;
	};
