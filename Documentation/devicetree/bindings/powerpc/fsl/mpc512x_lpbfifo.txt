Freescale MPC512x LocalPlus Bus FIFO (called SCLPC in the Reference Manual)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,mpc512x-lpbfifo";
- reg: should contain the offset and length of SCLPC register set;
- interrupts: should contain the interrupt specifier for SCLPC; syntax of an
    interrupt client node is described in interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt;
- dmas: should contain the DMA specifier for SCLPC as described at
    dma/dma.txt and dma/mpc512x-dma.txt;
- dma-names: should be "rx-tx";

Example:

	sclpc@10100 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc512x-lpbfifo";
		reg = <0x10100 0x50>;
		interrupts = <7 0x8>;
		dmas = <&dma0 26>;
		dma-names = "rx-tx";
	};
