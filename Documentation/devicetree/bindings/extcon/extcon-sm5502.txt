* SM5502 MUIC (Micro-USB Interface Controller) device

The Silicon Mitus SM5502 is a MUIC (Micro-USB Interface Controller) device
which can detect the state of external accessory when external accessory is
attached or detached and button is pressed or released. It is interfaced to
the host controller using an I2C interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "siliconmitus,sm5502-muic"
- reg: Specifies the I2C slave address of the MUIC block. It should be 0x25
- interrupts: Interrupt specifiers for detection interrupt sources.

Example:

	sm5502@25 {
		compatible = "siliconmitus,sm5502-muic";
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx1>;
		interrupts = <5 0>;
		reg = <0x25>;
	};
