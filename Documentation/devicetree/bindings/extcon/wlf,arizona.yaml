properties:
  wlf,hpdet-channel:
    description:
      Headphone detection channel.  ARIZONA_ACCDET_MODE_HPL/1 sets the
      headphone detect mode to HPDETL, ARIZONA_ACCDET_MODE_HPR/2 sets it
      to HPDETR.  If this node is not included or if the value is unknown,
      then headphone detection mode is set to HPDETL.
