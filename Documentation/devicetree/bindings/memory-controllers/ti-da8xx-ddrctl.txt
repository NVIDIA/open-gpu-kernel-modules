* Device tree bindings for Texas Instruments da8xx DDR2/mDDR memory controller

The DDR2/mDDR memory controller present on Texas Instruments da8xx SoCs features
a set of registers which allow to tweak the controller's behavior.

Documentation:
OMAP-L138 (DA850) - http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh82c/spruh82c.pdf

Required properties:

- compatible:		"ti,da850-ddr-controller" - for da850 SoC based boards
- reg:			a tuple containing the base address of the memory
			controller and the size of the memory area to map

Example for da850 shown below.

ddrctl {
	compatible = "ti,da850-ddr-controller";
	reg = <0xb0000000 0xe8>;
};
