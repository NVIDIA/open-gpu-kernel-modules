  This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
  TX controller (DWC HDMI TX) IP core. It doesn't constitute a full device tree
  binding specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by device tree
  bindings for the platform-specific integrations of the DWC HDMI TX.

  When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
  this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.
