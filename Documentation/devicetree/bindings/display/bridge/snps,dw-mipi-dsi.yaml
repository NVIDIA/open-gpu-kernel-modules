description: |
  This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI
  DSI host controller. It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification
  by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific device tree
  bindings.

  When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
  this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.
