description: |
  The IDK-2121WR from Advantech is a Full-HD dual-LVDS panel.
  A dual-LVDS interface is a dual-link connection with even pixels traveling
  on one link, and with odd pixels traveling on the other link.

  The panel expects odd pixels on the first port, and even pixels on the
  second port, therefore the ports must be marked accordingly (with either
  dual-lvds-odd-pixels or dual-lvds-even-pixels).
