Mediatek DSI Device
===================

The Mediatek DSI function block is a sink of the display subsystem and can
drive up to 4-lane MIPI DSI output. Two DSIs can be synchronized for dual-
channel output.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-dsi"
- the supported chips are mt2701, mt7623, mt8173 and mt8183.
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "engine", "digital", and "hs"
- phys: phandle link to the MIPI D-PHY controller.
- phy-names: must contain "dphy"
- port: Output port node with endpoint definitions as described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. This port should be connected
  to the input port of an attached DSI panel or DSI-to-eDP encoder chip.

Example:

mipi_tx0: mipi-dphy@10215000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mipi-tx";
	reg = <0 0x10215000 0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&clk26m>;
	clock-output-names = "mipi_tx0_pll";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
	drive-strength-microamp = <4600>;
	nvmem-cells= <&mipi_tx_calibration>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "calibration-data";
};

dsi0: dsi@1401b000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-dsi";
	reg = <0 0x1401b000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 192 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	clocks = <&mmsys MM_DSI0_ENGINE>, <&mmsys MM_DSI0_DIGITAL>,
		 <&mipi_tx0>;
	clock-names = "engine", "digital", "hs";
	phys = <&mipi_tx0>;
	phy-names = "dphy";

	port {
		dsi0_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
		};
	};
};
