Multi-Inno MI0283QT display panel

Required properties:
- compatible:	"multi-inno,mi0283qt".

The node for this driver must be a child node of a SPI controller, hence
all mandatory properties described in ../spi/spi-bus.txt must be specified.

Optional properties:
- dc-gpios:	D/C pin. The presence/absence of this GPIO determines
		the panel interface mode (IM[3:0] pins):
		- present: IM=x110 4-wire 8-bit data serial interface
		- absent:  IM=x101 3-wire 9-bit data serial interface
- reset-gpios:	Reset pin
- power-supply:	A regulator node for the supply voltage.
- backlight:	phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
- rotation:	panel rotation in degrees counter clockwise (0,90,180,270)

Example:
	mi0283qt@0{
		compatible = "multi-inno,mi0283qt";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <32000000>;
		rotation = <90>;
		dc-gpios = <&gpio 25 0>;
		backlight = <&backlight>;
	};
