* Solomon SSD1307 Framebuffer Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "solomon,<chip>fb-<bus>". The only supported bus for
    now is i2c, and the supported chips are ssd1305, ssd1306, ssd1307 and
    ssd1309.
  - reg: Should contain address of the controller on the I2C bus. Most likely
         0x3c or 0x3d
  - pwm: Should contain the pwm to use according to the OF device tree PWM
         specification [0]. Only required for the ssd1307.
  - solomon,height: Height in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
  - solomon,width: Width in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
  - solomon,page-offset: Offset of pages (band of 8 pixels) that the screen is
    mapped to.

Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios: The GPIO used to reset the OLED display, if available. See
                 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for details.
  - vbat-supply: The supply for VBAT
  - solomon,segment-no-remap: Display needs normal (non-inverted) data column
                              to segment mapping
  - solomon,col-offset: Offset of columns (COL/SEG) that the screen is mapped to.
  - solomon,com-seq: Display uses sequential COM pin configuration
  - solomon,com-lrremap: Display uses left-right COM pin remap
  - solomon,com-invdir: Display uses inverted COM pin scan direction
  - solomon,com-offset: Number of the COM pin wired to the first display line
  - solomon,prechargep1: Length of deselect period (phase 1) in clock cycles.
  - solomon,prechargep2: Length of precharge period (phase 2) in clock cycles.
                         This needs to be the higher, the higher the capacitance
                         of the OLED's pixels is
  - solomon,dclk-div: Clock divisor 1 to 16
  - solomon,dclk-frq: Clock frequency 0 to 15, higher value means higher
                      frequency
  - solomon,lookup-table: 8 bit value array of current drive pulse widths for
                          BANK0, and colors A, B, and C. Each value in range
                          of 31 to 63 for pulse widths of 32 to 64. Color D
                          is always width 64.
  - solomon,area-color-enable: Display uses color mode
  - solomon,low-power. Display runs in low power mode
