Qualcomm Technologies Inc. adreno/snapdragon eDP output

Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdss-edp"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of controller and PLL
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "edp"
  * "pll_base"
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the eDP block.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "core"
  * "iface"
  * "mdp_core"
  * "pixel"
  * "link"
- #clock-cells: The value should be 1.
- vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node
- lvl-vdd-supply: phandle to regulator device node which is used to supply power
  to HPD receiving chip
- panel-en-gpios: GPIO pin to supply power to panel.
- panel-hpd-gpios: GPIO pin used for eDP hpd.
