HDMI PHY:
Required properties:
- compatible: Could be the following
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8660"
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8960"
  * "qcom,hdmi-phy-8974"

- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- core-vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node
