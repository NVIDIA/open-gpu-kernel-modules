Qualcomm adreno/snapdragon GPU

Required properties:
- compatible: "qcom,adreno-XYZ.W", "qcom,adreno" or
	      "amd,imageon-XYZ.W", "amd,imageon"
    for example: "qcom,adreno-306.0", "qcom,adreno"
  Note that you need to list the less specific "qcom,adreno" (since this
  is what the device is matched on), in addition to the more specific
  with the chip-id.
  If "amd,imageon" is used, there should be no top level msm device.
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the gpu.
- clocks: device clocks (if applicable)
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required by a3xx, a4xx and a5xx
  cores:
  * "core"
  * "iface"
  * "mem_iface"
  For GMU attached devices the GPU clocks are not used and are not required. The
  following devices should not list clocks:
   - qcom,adreno-630.2
- iommus: optional phandle to an adreno iommu instance
- operating-points-v2: optional phandle to the OPP operating points
- interconnects: optional phandle to an interconnect provider.  See
  ../interconnect/interconnect.txt for details. Some A3xx and all A4xx platforms
  will have two paths; all others will have one path.
- interconnect-names: The names of the interconnect paths that correspond to the
  interconnects property. Values must be gfx-mem and ocmem.
- qcom,gmu: For GMU attached devices a phandle to the GMU device that will
  control the power for the GPU. Applicable targets:
    - qcom,adreno-630.2
- zap-shader: For a5xx and a6xx devices this node contains a memory-region that
  points to reserved memory to store the zap shader that can be used to help
  bring the GPU out of secure mode.
- firmware-name: optional property of the 'zap-shader' node, listing the
  relative path of the device specific zap firmware.
- sram: phandle to the On Chip Memory (OCMEM) that's present on some a3xx and
        a4xx Snapdragon SoCs. See
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/qcom,ocmem.yaml.

Optional properties:
- #cooling-cells: The value must be 2. For details, please refer
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal-cooling-devices.yaml.
