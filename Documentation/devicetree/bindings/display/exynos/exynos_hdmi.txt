Device-Tree bindings for drm hdmi driver

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one among the following:
	1) "samsung,exynos4210-hdmi"
	2) "samsung,exynos4212-hdmi"
	3) "samsung,exynos5420-hdmi"
	4) "samsung,exynos5433-hdmi"
- reg: physical base address of the hdmi and length of memory mapped
	region.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- hpd-gpios: following information about the hotplug gpio pin.
	a) phandle of the gpio controller node.
	b) pin number within the gpio controller.
	c) optional flags and pull up/down.
- ddc: phandle to the hdmi ddc node
- phy: phandle to the hdmi phy node
- samsung,syscon-phandle: phandle for system controller node for PMU.
- #sound-dai-cells: should be 0.

Required properties for Exynos 4210, 4212, 5420 and 5433:
- clocks: list of clock IDs from SoC clock driver.
	a) hdmi: Gate of HDMI IP bus clock.
	b) sclk_hdmi: Gate of HDMI special clock.
	c) sclk_pixel: Pixel special clock, one of the two possible inputs of
		HDMI clock mux.
	d) sclk_hdmiphy: HDMI PHY clock output, one of two possible inputs of
		HDMI clock mux.
	e) mout_hdmi: It is required by the driver to switch between the 2
		parents i.e. sclk_pixel and sclk_hdmiphy. If hdmiphy is stable
		after configuration, parent is set to sclk_hdmiphy else
		sclk_pixel.
- clock-names: aliases as per driver requirements for above clock IDs:
	"hdmi", "sclk_hdmi", "sclk_pixel", "sclk_hdmiphy" and "mout_hdmi".

Required properties for Exynos 5433:
- clocks: list of clock specifiers according to common clock bindings.
	a) hdmi_pclk: Gate of HDMI IP APB bus.
	b) hdmi_i_pclk: Gate of HDMI-PHY IP APB bus.
	d) i_tmds_clk: Gate of HDMI TMDS clock.
	e) i_pixel_clk: Gate of HDMI pixel clock.
	f) i_spdif_clk: Gate of HDMI SPDIF clock.
	g) oscclk: Oscillator clock, used as parent of following *_user clocks
		in case HDMI-PHY is not operational.
	h) tmds_clko: TMDS clock generated by HDMI-PHY.
	i) tmds_clko_user: MUX used to switch between oscclk and tmds_clko,
		respectively if HDMI-PHY is off and operational.
	j) pixel_clko: Pixel clock generated by HDMI-PHY.
	k) pixel_clko_user: MUX used to switch between oscclk and pixel_clko,
		respectively if HDMI-PHY is off and operational.
- clock-names: aliases for above clock specfiers.
- samsung,sysreg: handle to syscon used to control the system registers.

Example:

	hdmi {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4212-hdmi";
		reg = <0x14530000 0x100000>;
		interrupts = <0 95 0>;
		hpd-gpios = <&gpx3 7 1>;
		ddc = <&hdmi_ddc_node>;
		phy = <&hdmi_phy_node>;
		samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_system_controller>;
	};
