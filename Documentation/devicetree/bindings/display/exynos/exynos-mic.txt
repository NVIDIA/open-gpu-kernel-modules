Device-Tree bindings for Samsung Exynos SoC mobile image compressor (MIC)

MIC (mobile image compressor) resides between decon and mipi dsi. Mipi dsi is
not capable to transfer high resoltuion frame data as decon can send. MIC
solves this problem by compressing the frame data by 1/2 before it is
transferred through mipi dsi. The compressed frame data must be uncompressed in
the panel PCB.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be "samsung,exynos5433-mic".
- reg: physical base address and length of the MIC registers set and system
       register of mic.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "pclk_mic0", "sclk_rgb_vclk_to_mic0".
- samsung,disp-syscon: the reference node for syscon for DISP block.
- ports: contains a port which is connected to decon node and dsi node.
	 address-cells and size-cells must 1 and 0, respectively.
- port: contains an endpoint node which is connected to the endpoint in the
	decon node or dsi node. The reg value must be 0 and 1 respectively.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:
mic: mic@13930000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos5433-mic";
	reg = <0x13930000 0x48>;
	clocks = <&cmu_disp CLK_PCLK_MIC0>,
	       <&cmu_disp CLK_SCLK_RGB_VCLK_TO_MIC0>;
	clock-names = "pclk_mic0", "sclk_rgb_vclk_to_mic0";
	samsung,disp-syscon = <&syscon_disp>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			mic_to_decon: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&decon_to_mic>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			mic_to_dsi: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_to_mic>;
			};
		};
	};
};
