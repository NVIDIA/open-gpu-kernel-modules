Device-Tree bindings for Samsung Exynos SoC display controller (DECON)

DECON (Display and Enhancement Controller) is the Display Controller for the
Exynos series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of:
	"samsung,exynos5433-decon", "samsung,exynos5433-decon-tv";
- reg: physical base address and length of the DECON registers set.
- interrupt-names: should contain the interrupt names depending on mode of work:
		video mode: "vsync",
		command mode: "lcd_sys",
		command mode with software trigger: "lcd_sys", "te".
- interrupts or interrupts-extended: list of interrupt specifiers corresponding
		to names privided in interrupt-names, as described in
		interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "pclk", "aclk_decon", "aclk_smmu_decon0x",
	       "aclk_xiu_decon0x", "pclk_smmu_decon0x", "aclk_smmu_decon1x",
	       "aclk_xiu_decon1x", "pclk_smmu_decon1x", clk_decon_vclk",
	       "sclk_decon_eclk"
- ports: contains a port which is connected to mic node. address-cells and
	 size-cells must 1 and 0, respectively.
- port: contains an endpoint node which is connected to the endpoint in the mic
	node. The reg value muset be 0.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:
decon: decon@13800000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos5433-decon";
	reg = <0x13800000 0x2104>;
	clocks = <&cmu_disp CLK_ACLK_DECON>, <&cmu_disp CLK_ACLK_SMMU_DECON0X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_ACLK_XIU_DECON0X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_PCLK_SMMU_DECON0X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_ACLK_SMMU_DECON1X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_ACLK_XIU_DECON1X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_PCLK_SMMU_DECON1X>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_SCLK_DECON_VCLK>,
		<&cmu_disp CLK_SCLK_DECON_ECLK>;
	clock-names = "aclk_decon", "aclk_smmu_decon0x", "aclk_xiu_decon0x",
		"pclk_smmu_decon0x", "aclk_smmu_decon1x", "aclk_xiu_decon1x",
		"pclk_smmu_decon1x", "sclk_decon_vclk", "sclk_decon_eclk";
	interrupt-names = "vsync", "lcd_sys";
	interrupts = <0 202 0>, <0 203 0>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			decon_to_mic: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mic_to_decon>;
			};
		};
	};
};
