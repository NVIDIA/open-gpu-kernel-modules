Device Tree bindings for Freescale DCU DRM Driver

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of
	* "fsl,ls1021a-dcu".
	* "fsl,vf610-dcu".

- reg:			Address and length of the register set for dcu.
- clocks:		Handle to "dcu" and "pix" clock (in the order below)
			This can be the same clock (e.g. LS1021a)
			See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names:		Should be "dcu" and "pix"
			See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- big-endian		Boolean property, LS1021A DCU registers are big-endian.
- port			Video port for the panel output

Optional properties:
- fsl,tcon:		The phandle to the timing controller node.

Examples:
dcu: dcu@2ce0000 {
	compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-dcu";
	reg = <0x0 0x2ce0000 0x0 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&platform_clk 0>, <&platform_clk 0>;
	clock-names = "dcu", "pix";
	big-endian;
	fsl,tcon = <&tcon>;

	port {
		dcu_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&panel_out>;
	     };
	};
};
