MediaTek High-Speed DMA Controller
==================================

This device follows the generic DMA bindings defined in dma/dma.txt.

Required properties:

- compatible:	Must be one of
		  "mediatek,mt7622-hsdma": for MT7622 SoC
		  "mediatek,mt7623-hsdma": for MT7623 SoC
- reg:		Should contain the register's base address and length.
- interrupts:	Should contain a reference to the interrupt used by this
		device.
- clocks:	Should be the clock specifiers corresponding to the entry in
		clock-names property.
- clock-names:	Should contain "hsdma" entries.
- power-domains: Phandle to the power domain that the device is part of
- #dma-cells: 	The length of the DMA specifier, must be <1>. This one cell
		in dmas property of a client device represents the channel
		number.
Example:

        hsdma: dma-controller@1b007000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-hsdma";
		reg = <0 0x1b007000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 98 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_HSDMA>;
		clock-names = "hsdma";
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT2701_POWER_DOMAIN_ETH>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
	};

DMA clients must use the format described in dma/dma.txt file.
