title: STMicroelectronics STM32 DMA Controller bindings

description: |
  The STM32 DMA is a general-purpose direct memory access controller capable of
  supporting 8 independent DMA channels. Each channel can have up to 8 requests.
  DMA clients connected to the STM32 DMA controller must use the format
  described in the dma.txt file, using a four-cell specifier for each
  channel: a phandle to the DMA controller plus the following four integer cells:
    1. The channel id
    2. The request line number
    3. A 32bit mask specifying the DMA channel configuration which are device
      dependent:
        -bit 9: Peripheral Increment Address
          0x0: no address increment between transfers
          0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 10: Memory Increment Address
          0x0: no address increment between transfers
          0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 15: Peripheral Increment Offset Size
          0x0: offset size is linked to the peripheral bus width
          0x1: offset size is fixed to 4 (32-bit alignment)
        -bit 16-17: Priority level
          0x0: low
          0x1: medium
          0x2: high
          0x3: very high
    4. A 32bit bitfield value specifying DMA features which are device dependent:
       -bit 0-1: DMA FIFO threshold selection
         0x0: 1/4 full FIFO
         0x1: 1/2 full FIFO
         0x2: 3/4 full FIFO
         0x3: full FIFO
       -bit 2: DMA direct mode
         0x0: FIFO mode with threshold selectable with bit 0-1
         0x1: Direct mode: each DMA request immediately initiates a transfer
              from/to the memory, FIFO is bypassed.
