* Milbeaut AHB DMA Controller

Milbeaut AHB DMA controller has transfer capability below.
 - device to memory transfer
 - memory to device transfer

Required property:
- compatible:       Should be  "socionext,milbeaut-m10v-hdmac"
- reg:              Should contain DMA registers location and length.
- interrupts:       Should contain all of the per-channel DMA interrupts.
                     Number of channels is configurable - 2, 4 or 8, so
                     the number of interrupts specified should be {2,4,8}.
- #dma-cells:       Should be 1. Specify the ID of the slave.
- clocks:           Phandle to the clock used by the HDMAC module.


Example:

	hdmac1: dma-controller@1e110000 {
		compatible = "socionext,milbeaut-m10v-hdmac";
		reg = <0x1e110000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 132 4>,
			     <0 133 4>,
			     <0 134 4>,
			     <0 135 4>,
			     <0 136 4>,
			     <0 137 4>,
			     <0 138 4>,
			     <0 139 4>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&dummy_clk>;
	};
