* Marvell XOR v2 engines

Required properties:
- compatible: one of the following values:
    "marvell,armada-7k-xor"
    "marvell,xor-v2"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length (two sets)
    the first set is the DMA registers
    the second set is the global registers
- msi-parent: Phandle to the MSI-capable interrupt controller used for
  interrupts.

Optional properties:
- clocks: Optional reference to the clocks used by the XOR engine.
- clock-names: mandatory if there is a second clock, in this case the
   name must be "core" for the first clock and "reg" for the second
   one


Example:

	xor0@400000 {
		compatible = "marvell,xor-v2";
		reg = <0x400000 0x1000>,
		      <0x410000 0x1000>;
		msi-parent = <&gic_v2m0>;
		dma-coherent;
	};
