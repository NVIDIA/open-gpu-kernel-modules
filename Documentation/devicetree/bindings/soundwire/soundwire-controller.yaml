  SoundWire busses can be described with a node for the SoundWire controller
  device and a set of child nodes for each SoundWire slave on the bus.

        description: Is the textual representation of SoundWire Enumeration
          address. compatible string should contain SoundWire Version ID,
          Manufacturer ID, Part ID and Class ID in order and shall be in
          lower-case hexadecimal with leading zeroes.
          Valid sizes of these fields are
          Version ID is 1 nibble, number '0x1' represents SoundWire 1.0
          and '0x2' represents SoundWire 1.1 and so on.
          MFD is 4 nibbles
          PID is 4 nibbles
          CID is 2 nibbles
          More Information on detail of encoding of these fields can be
          found in MIPI Alliance DisCo & SoundWire 1.0 Specifications.
