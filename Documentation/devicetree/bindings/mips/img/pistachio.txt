Imagination Pistachio SoC
=========================

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible: Must include "img,pistachio".

CPU nodes:
----------
A "cpus" node is required.  Required properties:
 - #address-cells: Must be 1.
 - #size-cells: Must be 0.
A CPU sub-node is also required for at least CPU 0.  Since the topology may
be probed via CPS, it is not necessary to specify secondary CPUs.  Required
propertis:
 - device_type: Must be "cpu".
 - compatible: Must be "mti,interaptiv".
 - reg: CPU number.
 - clocks: Must include the CPU clock.  See ../../clock/clock-bindings.txt for
   details on clock bindings.
Example:
	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpu0: cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "mti,interaptiv";
			reg = <0>;
			clocks = <&clk_core CLK_MIPS>;
		};
	};


Boot protocol:
--------------
In accordance with the MIPS UHI specification[1], the bootloader must pass the
following arguments to the kernel:
 - $a0: -2.
 - $a1: KSEG0 address of the flattened device-tree blob.
