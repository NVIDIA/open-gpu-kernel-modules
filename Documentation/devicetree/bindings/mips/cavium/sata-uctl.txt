* UCTL SATA controller glue

UCTL is the bridge unit between the I/O interconnect (an internal bus)
and the SATA AHCI host controller (UAHC). It performs the following functions:
	- provides interfaces for the applications to access the UAHC AHCI
	  registers on the CN71XX I/O space.
	- provides a bridge for UAHC to fetch AHCI command table entries and data
	  buffers from Level 2 Cache.
	- posts interrupts to the CIU.
	- contains registers that:
		- control the behavior of the UAHC
		- control the clock/reset generation to UAHC
		- control endian swapping for all UAHC registers and DMA accesses

Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7130-sata-uctl"

  Compatibility with the cn7130 SOC.

- reg: The base address of the UCTL register bank.

- #address-cells, #size-cells, ranges and dma-ranges must be present and hold
	suitable values to map all child nodes.

Example:

	uctl@118006c000000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-7130-sata-uctl";
		reg = <0x11800 0x6c000000 0x0 0x100>;
		ranges; /* Direct mapping */
		dma-ranges;
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;

		sata: sata@16c0000000000 {
			compatible = "cavium,octeon-7130-ahci";
			reg = <0x16c00 0x00000000 0x0 0x200>;
			interrupt-parent = <&cibsata>;
			interrupts = <2 4>; /* Bit: 2, level */
		};
	};
