Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
	"snps,dw-high-reset" - for active high configuration
	"snps,dw-low-reset" - for active low configuration

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.

- #reset-cells: must be 1.

example:

	dw_rst_1: reset-controller@0000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-high-reset";
		reg = <0x0000 0x4>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

	dw_rst_2: reset-controller@1000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-low-reset";
		reg = <0x1000 0x8>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};
