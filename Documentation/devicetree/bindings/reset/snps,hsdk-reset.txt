Binding for the Synopsys HSDK reset controller

This binding uses the common reset binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "snps,hsdk-reset".
- reg: should always contain 2 pairs address - length: first for reset
  configuration register and second for corresponding SW reset and status bits
  register.
- #reset-cells: from common reset binding; Should always be set to 1.

Example:
	reset: reset@880 {
		compatible = "snps,hsdk-reset";
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x8A0 0x4>, <0xFF0 0x4>;
	};

Specifying reset lines connected to IP modules:
	ethernet@.... {
		....
		resets = <&reset HSDK_V1_ETH_RESET>;
		....
	};
