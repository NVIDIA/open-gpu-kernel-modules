Marvell Berlin reset controller
===============================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

The reset controller node must be a sub-node of the chip controller
node on Berlin SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "marvell,berlin2-reset"
- #reset-cells: must be set to 2

Example:

chip_rst: reset {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-reset";
	#reset-cells = <2>;
};

&usb_phy0 {
	resets = <&chip_rst 0x104 12>;
};
