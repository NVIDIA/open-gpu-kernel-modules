Broadcom STB SW_INIT-style reset controller
===========================================

Broadcom STB SoCs have a SW_INIT-style reset controller with separate
SET/CLEAR/STATUS registers and possibly multiple banks, each of 32 bit
reset lines.

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be brcm,brcmstb-reset
- reg: register base and length
- #reset-cells: must be set to 1

Example:

	reset: reset-controller@8404318 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-reset";
		reg = <0x8404318 0x30>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

	&ethernet_switch {
		resets = <&reset 26>;
		reset-names = "switch";
	};
