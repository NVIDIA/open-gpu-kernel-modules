description:
  This document lists a set of generic properties for describing UARTs in a
  device tree.  Whether these properties apply to a particular device depends
  on the DT bindings for the actual device.

  Each enabled UART may have an optional "serialN" alias in the "aliases" node,
  where N is the port number (non-negative decimal integer) as printed on the
  label next to the physical port.

    description:
      The presence of this property indicates that the UART has dedicated lines
      for RTS/CTS hardware flow control, and that they are available for use
      (wired and enabled by pinmux configuration).  This depends on both the
      UART hardware and the board wiring.

        Serial attached devices shall be a child node of the host UART device
        the slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached
        device is the only child node of the UART device. The slave device node
        name shall reflect the generic type of device for the node.

          $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
          description:
            The maximum baud rate the device operates at.
            This should only be present if the maximum is less than the slave
            device can support.  For example, a particular board has some
            signal quality issue or the host processor can't support higher
            baud rates.

        current-speed:
          $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
          description: |
            The current baud rate the device operates at.
            This should only be present in case a driver has no chance to know
            the baud rate of the slave device.
            Examples:
              * device supports auto-baud
              * the rate is setup by a bootloader and there is no way to reset
                the device
              * device baud rate is configured by its firmware but there is no
                way to request the actual settings
