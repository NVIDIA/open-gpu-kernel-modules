Bindings for cadence I3C master block
=====================================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: shall be "cdns,i3c-master"
- clocks: shall reference the pclk and sysclk
- clock-names: shall contain "pclk" and "sysclk"
- interrupts: the interrupt line connected to this I3C master
- reg: I3C master registers

Mandatory properties defined by the generic binding (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.yaml for more details):

- #address-cells: shall be set to 1
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0

Optional properties defined by the generic binding (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.yaml for more details):

- i2c-scl-hz
- i3c-scl-hz

I3C device connected on the bus follow the generic description (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.yaml for more details).

Example:

	i3c-master@0d040000 {
		compatible = "cdns,i3c-master";
		clocks = <&coreclock>, <&i3csysclock>;
		clock-names = "pclk", "sysclk";
		interrupts = <3 0>;
		reg = <0x0d040000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		i2c-scl-hz = <100000>;

		nunchuk: nunchuk@52 {
			compatible = "nintendo,nunchuk";
			reg = <0x52 0x0 0x10>;
		};
	};
