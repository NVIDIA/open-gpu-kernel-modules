The Linux Kernel documentation
==============================

This is the top level of the kernel's documentation tree.  Kernel
documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress;
that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the
documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if
you want to help out.

Licensing documentation
-----------------------

The following describes the license of the Linux kernel source code
(GPLv2), how to properly mark the license of individual files in the source
tree, as well as links to the full license text.

* :ref:`kernel_licensing`

User-oriented documentation
---------------------------

The following manuals are written for *users* of the kernel — those who are
trying to get it to work optimally on a given system.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   admin-guide/index
   kbuild/index

Firmware-related documentation
------------------------------
The following holds information on the kernel's expectations regarding the
platform firmwares.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   firmware-guide/index
   devicetree/index

Application-developer documentation
-----------------------------------

The user-space API manual gathers together documents describing aspects of
the kernel interface as seen by application developers.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   userspace-api/index


Introduction to kernel development
----------------------------------

These manuals contain overall information about how to develop the kernel.
The kernel community is quite large, with thousands of developers
contributing over the course of a year.  As with any large community,
knowing how things are done will make the process of getting your changes
merged much easier.

   doc-guide/index
   kernel-hacking/index

   maintainer/index
   fault-injection/index
   livepatch/index


Kernel API documentation
------------------------

These books get into the details of how specific kernel subsystems work
from the point of view of a kernel developer.  Much of the information here
is taken directly from the kernel source, with supplemental material added
as needed (or at least as we managed to add it — probably *not* all that is
needed).

Other documentation
-------------------

There are several unsorted documents that don't seem to fit on other parts
of the documentation body, or may require some adjustments and/or conversion
to ReStructured Text format, or are simply too old.
