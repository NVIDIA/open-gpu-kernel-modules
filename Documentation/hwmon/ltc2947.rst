Description
___________

The LTC2947 is a high precision power and energy monitor that measures current,
voltage, power, temperature, charge and energy. The device supports both SPI
and I2C depending on the chip configuration.
The device also measures accumulated quantities as energy. It has two banks of
register's to read/set energy related values. These banks can be configured
independently to have setups like: energy1 accumulates always and enrgy2 only
accumulates if current is positive (to check battery charging efficiency for
example). The device also supports a GPIO pin that can be configured as output
to control a fan as a function of measured temperature. Then, the GPIO becomes
active as soon as a temperature reading is higher than a defined threshold. The
temp2 channel is used to control this thresholds and to read the respective
alarms.
