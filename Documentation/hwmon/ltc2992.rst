Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for Linear Technology LTC2992 power monitor.

LTC2992 is a rail-to-rail system monitor that measures current,
voltage, and power of two supplies.

Two ADCs simultaneously measure each supplyâ€™s current. A third ADC monitors
the input voltages and four auxiliary external voltages.
