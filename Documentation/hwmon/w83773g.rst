Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Nuvoton W83773G temperature sensor
chip. This chip implements one local and two remote sensors.
The chip also features offsets for the two remote sensors which get added to
the input readings. The chip does all the scaling by itself and the driver
therefore reports true temperatures that don't need any user-space adjustments.
Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius.
The chip is wired over I2C/SMBus and specified over a temperature
range of -40 to +125 degrees Celsius (for local sensor) and -40 to +127
degrees Celsius (for remote sensors).
Resolution for both the local and remote channels is 0.125 degree C.

The chip supports only temperature measurement. The driver exports
the temperature values via the following sysfs files:

**temp[1-3]_input, temp[2-3]_fault, temp[2-3]_offset, update_interval**
