Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for National Semiconductor / TI LM25056,
LM25066, LM5064, and LM5066/LM5066I Power Management, Monitoring,
Control, and Protection ICs.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus.rst for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.rst for
details.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data.
