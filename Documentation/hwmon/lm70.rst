Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM70
temperature sensor.

The LM70 temperature sensor chip supports a single temperature sensor.
It communicates with a host processor (or microcontroller) via an
SPI/Microwire Bus interface.

Communication with the LM70 is simple: when the temperature is to be sensed,
the driver accesses the LM70 using SPI communication: 16 SCLK cycles
comprise the MOSI/MISO loop. At the end of the transfer, the 11-bit 2's
complement digital temperature (sent via the SIO line), is available in the
driver for interpretation. This driver makes use of the kernel's in-core
SPI support.

As a real (in-tree) example of this "SPI protocol driver" interfacing
with a "SPI master controller driver", see drivers/spi/spi_lm70llp.c
and its associated documentation.

The LM74 and TMP121/TMP122/TMP123/TMP124 are very similar; main difference is
13-bit temperature data (0.0625 degrees celsius resolution).

The TMP122/TMP124 also feature configurable temperature thresholds.

The LM71 is also very similar; main difference is 14-bit temperature
data (0.03125 degrees celsius resolution).
