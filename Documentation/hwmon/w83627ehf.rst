Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Winbond W83627EHF, W83627EHG,
W83627DHG, W83627DHG-P, W83627UHG, W83667HG, W83667HG-B, W83667HG-I
(NCT6775F), and NCT6776F super I/O chips. We will refer to them collectively
as Winbond chips.

The chips implement 3 to 4 temperature sensors (9 for NCT6775F and NCT6776F),
2 to 5 fan rotation speed sensors, 8 to 10 analog voltage sensors, one VID
(except for 627UHG), alarms with beep warnings (control unimplemented),
and some automatic fan regulation strategies (plus manual fan control mode).

The temperature sensor sources on W82677HG-B, NCT6775F, and NCT6776F are
configurable. temp4 and higher attributes are only reported if its temperature
source differs from the temperature sources of the already reported temperature
sensors. The configured source for each of the temperature sensors is provided
in tempX_label.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius and measurement resolution is 1
degC for temp1 and 0.5 degC for temp2 and temp3. For temp4 and higher,
resolution is 1 degC for W83667HG-B and 0.0 degC for NCT6775F and NCT6776F.
An alarm is triggered when the temperature gets higher than high limit;
it stays on until the temperature falls below the hysteresis value.
Alarms are only supported for temp1, temp2, and temp3.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is
triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan
readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or
128) to give the readings more range or accuracy. The driver sets the most
suitable fan divisor itself. Some fans might not be present because they
share pins with other functions.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in millivolts.
An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum
or maximum limit.

The driver supports automatic fan control mode known as Thermal Cruise.
In this mode, the chip attempts to keep the measured temperature in a
predefined temperature range. If the temperature goes out of range, fan
is driven slower/faster to reach the predefined range again.

The mode works for fan1-fan4. Mapping of temperatures to pwm outputs is as
follows::

  temp1 -> pwm1
  temp2 -> pwm2
  temp3 -> pwm3 (not on 627UHG)
  prog  -> pwm4 (not on 667HG and 667HG-B; the programmable setting is not
		 supported by the driver)

/sys files
----------

name
	this is a standard hwmon device entry, it contains the name of
	the device (see the prefix in the list of supported devices at
	the top of this file)

pwm[1-4]
	this file stores PWM duty cycle or DC value (fan speed) in range:

	   0 (stop) to 255 (full)

pwm[1-4]_enable
	this file controls mode of fan/temperature control:

	* 1 Manual mode, write to pwm file any value 0-255 (full speed)
	* 2 "Thermal Cruise" mode
	* 3 "Fan Speed Cruise" mode
	* 4 "Smart Fan III" mode
	* 5 "Smart Fan IV" mode

	SmartFan III mode is not supported on NCT6776F.

	SmartFan IV mode is configurable only if it was configured at system
	startup, and is only supported for W83677HG-B, NCT6775F, and NCT6776F.
	SmartFan IV operational parameters can not be configured at this time,
	and the various pwm attributes are not used in SmartFan IV mode.
	The attributes can be written to, which is useful if you plan to
	configure the system for a different pwm mode. However, the information
	returned when reading pwm attributes is unrelated to SmartFan IV
	operation.

pwm[1-4]_mode
	controls if output is PWM or DC level

	* 0 DC output (0 - 12v)
	* 1 PWM output

Thermal Cruise mode
-------------------

If the temperature is in the range defined by:

pwm[1-4]_target
		   set target temperature, unit millidegree Celsius
		   (range 0 - 127000)
pwm[1-4]_tolerance
		   tolerance, unit millidegree Celsius (range 0 - 15000)

there are no changes to fan speed. Once the temperature leaves the interval,
fan speed increases (temp is higher) or decreases if lower than desired.
There are defined steps and times, but not exported by the driver yet.

pwm[1-4]_min_output
		   minimum fan speed (range 1 - 255), when the temperature
		   is below defined range.
pwm[1-4]_stop_time
		   how many milliseconds [ms] must elapse to switch
		   corresponding fan off. (when the temperature was below
		   defined range).
pwm[1-4]_start_output
		   minimum fan speed (range 1 - 255) when spinning up
pwm[1-4]_step_output
		   rate of fan speed change (1 - 255)
pwm[1-4]_stop_output
		   minimum fan speed (range 1 - 255) when spinning down
pwm[1-4]_max_output
		   maximum fan speed (range 1 - 255), when the temperature
		   is above defined range.

Note: last six functions are influenced by other control bits, not yet exported
      by the driver, so a change might not have any effect.

Implementation Details
----------------------

Future driver development should bear in mind that the following registers have
different functions on the 627EHF and the 627DHG. Some registers also have
different power-on default values, but BIOS should already be loading
appropriate defaults. Note that bank selection must be performed as is currently
done in the driver for all register addresses.

			    - "Reserved Register" for the DHG
========================= =====================================================

The DHG also supports PECI, where the DHG queries Intel CPU temperatures, and
the ICH8 southbridge gets that data via PECI from the DHG, so that the
southbridge drives the fans. And the DHG supports SST, a one-wire serial bus.

The DHG-P has an additional automatic fan speed control mode named Smart Fan
(TM) III+. This mode is not yet supported by the driver.
