Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Texas Instruments ADC128D818.
It is described as 'ADC System Monitor with Temperature Sensor'.

The ADC128D818 implements one temperature sensor and seven voltage sensors.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. There is one set of limits.
When the HOT Temperature Limit is crossed, this will cause an alarm that will
be reasserted until the temperature drops below the HOT Hysteresis.
Measurements are guaranteed between -55 and +125 degrees. The temperature
measurement has a resolution of 0.5 degrees; the limits have a resolution
of 1 degree.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts.
An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum
or maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to
zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage
inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 2.55 volts, with a resolution
of 0.625 mV.

If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register
is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may
already have disappeared by the time the alarm is read. The driver
caches the alarm status for each sensor until it is at least reported
once, to ensure that alarms are reported to user space.

The ADC128D818 only updates its values approximately once per second;
reading it more often will do no harm, but will return 'old' values.

In addition to the scanned address list, the chip can also be configured for
addresses 0x35 to 0x37. Those addresses are not scanned. You have to instantiate
the driver explicitly if the chip is configured for any of those addresses in
your system.
