Description
-----------

The ADM1030 and ADM1031 are digital temperature sensors and fan controllers.
They sense their own temperature as well as the temperature of up to one
(ADM1030) or two (ADM1031) external diodes.

All temperature values are given in degrees Celsius. Resolution is 0.5
degree for the local temperature, 0.125 degree for the remote temperatures.

Each temperature channel has its own high and low limits, plus a critical
limit.

The ADM1030 monitors a single fan speed, while the ADM1031 monitors up to
two. Each fan channel has its own low speed limit.
