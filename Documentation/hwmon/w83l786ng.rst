Module Parameters
-----------------

* reset boolean
    (default 0)

    Use 'reset=1' to reset the chip (via index 0x40, bit 7). The default
    behavior is no chip reset to preserve BIOS settings


Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Winbond W83L786NG/W83L786NR chips.

The driver implements two temperature sensors, two fan rotation speed
sensors, and three voltage sensors.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius and measurement resolution is 1
degC for temp1 and temp2.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). Fan readings
can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
or 128 for fan 1/2) to give the readings more range or accuracy.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in millivolts.
An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum
or maximum limit.
