Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for Intersil / Zilker Labs ZL6100 and
compatible digital DC-DC controllers.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus.rst and Documentation.hwmon/pmbus-core for details
on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.rst for
details.

.. warning::

  Do not access chip registers using the i2cdump command, and do not use
  any of the i2ctools commands on a command register used to save and restore
  configuration data (0x11, 0x12, 0x15, 0x16, and 0xf4). The chips supported by
  this driver interpret any access to those command registers (including read
  commands) as request to execute the command in question. Unless write accesses
  to those registers are protected, this may result in power loss, board resets,
  and/or Flash corruption. Worst case, your board may turn into a brick.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data.


Module parameters
-----------------

delay
-----

Intersil/Zilker Labs DC-DC controllers require a minimum interval between I2C
bus accesses. According to Intersil, the minimum interval is 2 ms, though 1 ms
appears to be sufficient and has not caused any problems in testing. The problem
is known to affect all currently supported chips. For manual override, the
driver provides a writeable module parameter, 'delay', which can be used to set
the interval to a value between 0 and 65,535 microseconds.


Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported. Limits are read-write; all other
attributes are read-only.

======================= ========================================================
in1_label		"vin"
in1_input		Measured input voltage.
in1_min			Minimum input voltage.
in1_max			Maximum input voltage.
in1_lcrit		Critical minimum input voltage.
in1_crit		Critical maximum input voltage.
in1_min_alarm		Input voltage low alarm.
in1_max_alarm		Input voltage high alarm.
in1_lcrit_alarm		Input voltage critical low alarm.
in1_crit_alarm		Input voltage critical high alarm.

in2_label		"vmon"
in2_input		Measured voltage on VMON (ZL2004) or VDRV (ZL9101M,
			ZL9117M) pin. Reported voltage is 16x the voltage on the
			pin (adjusted internally by the chip).
in2_lcrit		Critical minimum VMON/VDRV Voltage.
in2_crit		Critical maximum VMON/VDRV voltage.
in2_lcrit_alarm		VMON/VDRV voltage critical low alarm.
in2_crit_alarm		VMON/VDRV voltage critical high alarm.

			vmon attributes are supported on ZL2004, ZL9101M,
			and ZL9117M only.
