Description
-----------

This driver supports the Lattice POWR1220AT8 chip. The POWR1220
includes voltage monitoring for 14 inputs as well as trim settings
for output voltages and GPIOs. This driver implements the voltage
monitoring portion of the chip.

Voltages are sampled by a 12-bit ADC with a step size of 2 mV.
An in-line attenuator allows measurements from 0 to 6 V. The
attenuator is enabled or disabled depending on the setting of the
input's max value. The driver will enable the attenuator for any
value over the low measurement range maximum of 2 V.

The input naming convention is as follows:

============== ========
driver name    pin name
============== ========
in0            VMON1
in1            VMON2
in2            VMON3
in2            VMON4
in4            VMON5

in11           VMON12
in12           VCCA
in13           VCCINP

The ADC readings are updated on request with a minimum period of 1s.
