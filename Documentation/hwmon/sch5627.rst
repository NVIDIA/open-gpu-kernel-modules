Description
-----------

SMSC SCH5627 Super I/O chips include complete hardware monitoring
capabilities. They can monitor up to 5 voltages, 4 fans and 8 temperatures.

The SMSC SCH5627 hardware monitoring part also contains an integrated
watchdog. In order for this watchdog to function some motherboard specific
initialization most be done by the BIOS, so if the watchdog is not enabled
by the BIOS the sch5627 driver will not register a watchdog device.

The hardware monitoring part of the SMSC SCH5627 is accessed by talking
through an embedded microcontroller. An application note describing the
protocol for communicating with the microcontroller is available upon
request. Please mail me if you want a copy.
