Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Maxim MAX31790 chip.

The MAX31790 controls the speeds of up to six fans using six independent
PWM outputs. The desired fan speeds (or PWM duty cycles) are written
through the I2C interface. The outputs drive "4-wire" fans directly,
or can be used to modulate the fan's power terminals using an external
pass transistor.

Tachometer inputs monitor fan tachometer logic outputs for precise (+/-1%)
monitoring and control of fan RPM as well as detection of fan failure.
Six pins are dedicated tachometer inputs. Any of the six PWM outputs can
also be configured to serve as tachometer inputs.
