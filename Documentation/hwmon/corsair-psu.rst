Description
-----------

This driver implements the sysfs interface for the Corsair PSUs with a HID protocol
interface of the HXi and RMi series.
These power supplies provide access to a micro-controller with 2 attached
temperature sensors, 1 fan rpm sensor, 4 sensors for volt levels, 4 sensors for
power usage and 4 sensors for current levels and addtional non-sensor information
like uptimes.

Usage Notes
-----------

It is an USB HID device, so it is auto-detected and supports hot-swapping.

Flickering values in the rail voltage levels can be an indicator for a failing
PSU. The driver also provides some additional useful values via debugfs, which
do not fit into the hwmon class.
