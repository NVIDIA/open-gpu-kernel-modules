Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Texas Instruments TMP421, TMP422,
TMP423, TMP441, and TMP442 temperature sensor chips. These chips
implement one local and up to one (TMP421, TMP441), up to two (TMP422,
TMP442) or up to three (TMP423) remote sensors. Temperature is measured
in degrees Celsius. The chips are wired over I2C/SMBus and specified
over a temperature range of -40 to +125 degrees Celsius. Resolution
for both the local and remote channels is 0.0625 degree C.

The chips support only temperature measurement. The driver exports
the temperature values via the following sysfs files:

**temp[1-4]_input**

**temp[2-4]_fault**
