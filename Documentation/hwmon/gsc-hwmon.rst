Kernel driver gsc-hwmon
=======================

Supported chips: Gateworks GSC
Datasheet: http://trac.gateworks.com/wiki/gsc
Author: Tim Harvey <tharvey@gateworks.com>

Description:
------------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for the temperature sensor,
various ADC's connected to the GSC, and optional FAN controller available
on some boards.


Voltage Monitoring
------------------

The voltage inputs are scaled either internally or by the driver depending
on the GSC version and firmware. The values returned by the driver do not need
further scaling. The voltage input labels provide the voltage rail name:

inX_input                  Measured voltage (mV).
inX_label                  Name of voltage rail.


Temperature Monitoring
----------------------

Temperatures are measured with 12-bit or 10-bit resolution and are scaled
either internally or by the driver depending on the GSC version and firmware.
The values returned by the driver reflect millidegree Celcius:

tempX_input                Measured temperature.
tempX_label                Name of temperature input.


PWM Output Control
------------------

The GSC features 1 PWM output that operates in automatic mode where the
PWM value will be scalled depending on 6 temperature boundaries.
The tempeature boundaries are read-write and in millidegree Celcius and the
read-only PWM values range from 0 (off) to 255 (full speed).
Fan speed will be set to minimum (off) when the temperature sensor reads
less than pwm1_auto_point1_temp and maximum when the temperature sensor
equals or exceeds pwm1_auto_point6_temp.

pwm1_auto_point[1-6]_pwm       PWM value.
pwm1_auto_point[1-6]_temp      Temperature boundary.
