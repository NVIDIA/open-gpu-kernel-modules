Description
-----------

The LTC4215 controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC4215 devices, due to the fact that some
of the possible addresses are unfriendly to probing. You will have to
instantiate the devices explicitly.

Example: the following will load the driver for an LTC4215 at address 0x44
on I2C bus #0::

	$ modprobe ltc4215
	$ echo ltc4215 0x44 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device


Sysfs entries
-------------

The LTC4215 has built-in limits for overvoltage, undervoltage, and
undercurrent warnings. This makes it very likely that the reference
circuit will be used.
