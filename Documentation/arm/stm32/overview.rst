STM32 ARM Linux Overview
========================

Introduction
------------

The STMicroelectronics STM32 family of Cortex-A microprocessors (MPUs) and
Cortex-M microcontrollers (MCUs) are supported by the 'STM32' platform of
ARM Linux.

Configuration
-------------

For MCUs, use the provided default configuration:
        make stm32_defconfig
For MPUs, use multi_v7 configuration:
        make multi_v7_defconfig

Layout
------

All the files for multiple machine families are located in the platform code
contained in arch/arm/mach-stm32

There is a generic board board-dt.c in the mach folder which support
Flattened Device Tree, which means, it works with any compatible board with
Device Trees.
