Linux Advanced Radio Terminal (LART)
====================================

The LART is a small (7.5 x 10cm) SA-1100 board, designed for embedded
applications. It has 32 MB DRAM, 4MB Flash ROM, double RS232 and all
other StrongARM-gadgets. Almost all SA signals are directly accessible
through a number of connectors. The powersupply accepts voltages
between 3.5V and 16V and is overdimensioned to support a range of
daughterboards. A quad Ethernet / IDE / PS2 / sound daughterboard
is under development, with plenty of others in different stages of
planning.

The hardware designs for this board have been released under an open license;
see the LART page at http://www.lartmaker.nl/ for more information.
