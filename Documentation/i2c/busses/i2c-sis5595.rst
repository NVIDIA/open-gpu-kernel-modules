   Note: these chips contain a 0008 device which is incompatible with the
         5595. We recognize these by the presence of the listed
         "blacklist" PCI ID and refuse to load.

Module Parameters
-----------------

==================	=====================================================
force_addr=0xaddr	Set the I/O base address. Useful for boards
			that don't set the address in the BIOS. Does not do a
			PCI force; the device must still be present in lspci.
			Don't use this unless the driver complains that the
			base address is not set.

Description
-----------

i2c-sis5595 is a true SMBus host driver for motherboards with the SiS5595
southbridges.

WARNING: If you are trying to access the integrated sensors on the SiS5595
chip, you want the sis5595 driver for those, not this driver. This driver
is a BUS driver, not a CHIP driver. A BUS driver is used by other CHIP
drivers to access chips on the bus.
