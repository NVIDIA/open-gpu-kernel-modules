Module Parameters
-----------------

==================      =====================================================
force = [1|0]           Forcibly enable the SIS630. DANGEROUS!
                        This can be interesting for chipsets not named
                        above to check if it works for you chipset,
                        but DANGEROUS!

high_clock = [1|0]      Forcibly set Host Master Clock to 56KHz (default,
			what your BIOS use). DANGEROUS! This should be a bit
			faster, but freeze some systems (i.e. my Laptop).
			SIS630/730 chip only.

Description
-----------

This SMBus only driver is known to work on motherboards with the above
named chipsets.

If you see something like this::

  00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 630 Host (rev 31)
  00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513

or like this::

  00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 730 Host (rev 02)
  00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513

or like this::

  00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 760/M760 Host (rev 02)
  00:02.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS964 [MuTIOL Media IO]
							LPC Controller (rev 36)

in your ``lspci`` output , then this driver is for your chipset.
