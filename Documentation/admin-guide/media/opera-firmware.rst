Opera firmware
==============

Author: Marco Gittler <g.marco@freenet.de>

To extract the firmware for the Opera DVB-S1 USB-Box
you need to copy the files:

2830SCap2.sys
2830SLoad2.sys

from the windriver disk into this directory.

Then run:

.. code-block:: none

	scripts/get_dvb_firmware opera1

and after that you have 2 files:

dvb-usb-opera-01.fw
dvb-usb-opera1-fpga-01.fw

in here.

Copy them into /lib/firmware/ .

After that the driver can load the firmware
(if you have enabled firmware loading
in kernel config and have hotplug running).
