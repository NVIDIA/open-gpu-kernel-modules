		  0 = /dev/ram0		First RAM disk
		  1 = /dev/ram1		Second RAM disk
		    ...
		250 = /dev/initrd	Initial RAM disk

		Older kernels had /dev/ramdisk (1, 1) here.
		/dev/initrd refers to a RAM disk which was preloaded
		by the boot loader; newer kernels use /dev/ram0 for
		the initrd.

   2 char	Pseudo-TTY masters
		  0 = /dev/ptyp0	First PTY master
		  1 = /dev/ptyp1	Second PTY master
		    ...
		255 = /dev/ptyef	256th PTY master

		Pseudo-tty's are named as follows:
		* Masters are "pty", slaves are "tty";
		* the fourth letter is one of pqrstuvwxyzabcde indicating
		  the 1st through 16th series of 16 pseudo-ttys each, and
		* the fifth letter is one of 0123456789abcdef indicating
		  the position within the series.

		These are the old-style (BSD) PTY devices; Unix98
		devices are on major 128 and above and use the PTY
		master multiplex (/dev/ptmx) to acquire a PTY on
		demand.

		(1) Autodetectable format

		NOTE: The letter in the device name (d, q, h or u)
		signifies the type of drive: 5.25" Double Density (d),
		5.25" Quad Density (q), 5.25" High Density (h) or 3.5"
		(any model, u).	 The use of the capital letters D, H
		and E for the 3.5" models have been deprecated, since
		the drive type is insignificant for these devices.

		  0 = /dev/hda		Master: whole disk (or CD-ROM)
		 64 = /dev/hdb		Slave: whole disk (or CD-ROM)

		For partitions, add to the whole disk device number:
		  0 = /dev/hd?		Whole disk
		  1 = /dev/hd?1		First partition
		  2 = /dev/hd?2		Second partition
		    ...
		 63 = /dev/hd?63	63rd partition

		For Linux/i386, partitions 1-4 are the primary
		partitions, and 5 and above are logical partitions.
		Other versions of Linux use partitioning schemes
		appropriate to their respective architectures.

   4 char	TTY devices
		  0 = /dev/tty0		Current virtual console

		  1 = /dev/tty1		First virtual console
		    ...
		 63 = /dev/tty63	63rd virtual console
		 64 = /dev/ttyS0	First UART serial port
		    ...
		255 = /dev/ttyS191	192nd UART serial port

		UART serial ports refer to 8250/16450/16550 series devices.

		Older versions of the Linux kernel used this major
		number for BSD PTY devices.  As of Linux 2.1.115, this
		is no longer supported.	 Use major numbers 2 and 3.

   4 block	Aliases for dynamically allocated major devices to be used

   6 char	Parallel printer devices
		  0 = /dev/lp0		Parallel printer on parport0
		  1 = /dev/lp1		Parallel printer on parport1

		 16 = /dev/sdb		Second SCSI disk whole disk
		 32 = /dev/sdc		Third SCSI disk whole disk

		    ...
		224 = /dev/nst0a	First SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		225 = /dev/nst1a	Second SCSI tape, mode 3, no rewind
		    ...

		"No rewind" refers to the omission of the default
		automatic rewind on device close.  The MTREW or MTOFFL
		ioctl()'s can be used to rewind the tape regardless of
		the device used to access it.

   9 block	Metadisk (RAID) devices
		  0 = /dev/md0		First metadisk group

		The OnStream SC-x0 SCSI tapes do not support the
		standard SCSI SASD command set and therefore need
		their own driver "osst". Note that the IDE, USB (and
		maybe ParPort) versions may be driven via ide-scsi or
		usb-storage SCSI emulation and this osst device and
		driver as well.  The ADR-x0 drives are QIC-157
		compliant and don't need osst.
