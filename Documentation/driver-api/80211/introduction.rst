Explaining wireless 802.11 networking in the Linux kernel

Copyright 2007-2009 Johannes Berg

These books attempt to give a description of the various subsystems
that play a role in 802.11 wireless networking in Linux. Since these
books are for kernel developers they attempts to document the
structures and functions used in the kernel as well as giving a
higher-level overview.

The reader is expected to be familiar with the 802.11 standard as
published by the IEEE in 802.11-2007 (or possibly later versions).
References to this standard will be given as "802.11-2007 8.1.5".
