	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD8366 and similar
	  gain amplifiers. This driver supports the following gain amplifiers
	  from Analog Devices:
	    AD8366 Dual-Digital Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)
	    ADA4961 BiCMOS RF Digital Gain Amplifier (DGA)
	    ADL5240 Digitally controlled variable gain amplifier (VGA)
	    HMC1119 0.25 dB LSB, 7-Bit, Silicon Digital Attenuator

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad8366.

	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices HMC425A and similar
	  gain amplifiers or step attenuators.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hmc425a.
