	help
	  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known Zorro device
	  names to make the information in /proc/iomem comprehensible to the
	  user. This database increases the size of the kernel image by about
	  15KB, but it gets freed after the system boots up, so it doesn't
	  take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you are building an installation
	  floppy or kernel for an embedded system where kernel image size
	  really matters, you can disable this feature and you'll get device
	  ID numbers instead of names.

	  When in doubt, say Y.
