	  This driver provides support for the LIS3LV02Dx accelerometer connected
	  via SPI. The accelerometer data is readable via
	  /sys/devices/platform/lis3lv02d.

	  This driver also provides an absolute input class device, allowing
	  the laptop to act as a pinball machine-esque joystick.

	  This driver can also be built as modules.  If so, the core module
	  will be called lis3lv02d and a specific module for the SPI transport
	  is called lis3lv02d_spi.
