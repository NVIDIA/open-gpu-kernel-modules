	  Select this option to enable driver support for IBM Coherent
	  Accelerators (CXL).  CXL is otherwise known as Coherent Accelerator
	  Processor Interface (CAPI).  CAPI allows accelerators in FPGAs to be
	  coherently attached to a CPU via an MMU.  This driver enables
	  userspace programs to access these accelerators via /dev/cxl/afuM.N
	  devices.

	  CAPI adapters are found in POWER8 based systems.

	  If unsure, say N.
