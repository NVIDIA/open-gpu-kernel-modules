	help
	  This option enables support for Silicon Labs C2 port used to
	  program Silicon micro controller chips (and other 8051 compatible).

	  If your board have no such micro controllers you don't need this

	  be called c2port_core. Note that you also need a client module
	  usually called c2port-*.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.
