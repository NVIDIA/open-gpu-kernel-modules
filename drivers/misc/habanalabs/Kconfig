	  Enables PCIe card driver for Habana's AI Processors (AIP) that are
	  designed to accelerate Deep Learning inference and training workloads.

	  The driver manages the PCIe devices and provides IOCTL interface for
	  the user to submit workloads to the devices.

	  The user-space interface is described in
	  include/uapi/misc/habanalabs.h

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called habanalabs.
