	  This supports the use of the I2C interface on Atmel AT91

	  A serious problem is that there is no documented way to issue

	  Caution! at91rm9200, at91sam9261, at91sam9260, at91sam9263 devices
	  don't have clock stretching in transmission mode. For that reason,
	  you can encounter underrun issues causing premature stop sendings if

comment "Other I2C/SMBus bus drivers"

config I2C_ACORN
	tristate "Acorn IOC/IOMD I2C bus support"
	depends on ARCH_ACORN
	default y
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  Say yes if you want to support the I2C bus on Acorn platforms.

	  If you don't know, say Y.

config I2C_ELEKTOR
	tristate "Elektor ISA card"
	depends on ISA && HAS_IOPORT_MAP && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	select I2C_ALGOPCF
	help
	  This supports the PCF8584 ISA bus I2C adapter.  Say Y if you own
	  such an adapter.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-elektor.

config I2C_ICY
	tristate "ICY Zorro card"
	depends on ZORRO
	select I2C_ALGOPCF
	help
	  This supports the PCF8584 Zorro bus I2C adapter, known as ICY.
	  Say Y if you own such an adapter.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-icy.

	  If you have a 2019 edition board with an LTC2990 sensor at address
	  0x4c, loading the module 'ltc2990' is sufficient to enable it.

config I2C_MLXCPLD
	tristate "Mellanox I2C driver"
	depends on X86_64 || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This exposes the Mellanox platform I2C busses to the linux I2C layer
	  for X86 based systems.
	  Controller is implemented as CPLD logic.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called as i2c-mlxcpld.

config I2C_PCA_ISA
	tristate "PCA9564/PCA9665 on an ISA bus"
	depends on ISA
	select I2C_ALGOPCA
	help
	  This driver supports ISA boards using the Philips PCA9564/PCA9665
	  parallel bus to I2C bus controller.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-pca-isa.

	  This device is almost undetectable and using this driver on a
	  system which doesn't have this device will result in long
	  delays when I2C/SMBus chip drivers are loaded (e.g. at boot
	  time).  If unsure, say N.

config I2C_SIBYTE
	tristate "SiByte SMBus interface"
	depends on SIBYTE_SB1xxx_SOC
	help
	  Supports the SiByte SOC on-chip I2C interfaces (2 channels).

config I2C_CROS_EC_TUNNEL
	tristate "ChromeOS EC tunnel I2C bus"
	depends on CROS_EC
	help
	  If you say yes here you get an I2C bus that will tunnel i2c commands
	  through to the other side of the ChromeOS EC to the i2c bus
	  connected there. This will work whatever the interface used to
	  talk to the EC (SPI, I2C or LPC).

config I2C_XGENE_SLIMPRO
	tristate "APM X-Gene SoC I2C SLIMpro devices support"
	depends on ARCH_XGENE && MAILBOX
	help
	  Enable I2C bus access using the APM X-Gene SoC SLIMpro
	  co-processor. The I2C device access the I2C bus via the X-Gene
	  to SLIMpro (On chip coprocessor) mailbox mechanism.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCx200_ACB
	tristate "Geode ACCESS.bus support"
	depends on X86_32 && PCI
	help
	  Enable the use of the ACCESS.bus controllers on the Geode SCx200 and
	  SC1100 processors and the CS5535 and CS5536 Geode companion devices.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called scx200_acb.

config I2C_OPAL
	tristate "IBM OPAL I2C driver"
	depends on PPC_POWERNV
	default y
	help
	  This exposes the PowerNV platform i2c busses to the linux i2c layer,
	  the driver is based on the OPAL interfaces.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called as i2c-opal.

config I2C_FSI
	tristate "FSI I2C driver"
	depends on FSI
	help
	  Driver for FSI bus attached I2C masters. These are I2C masters that
	  are connected to the system over an FSI bus, instead of the more
	  common PCI or MMIO interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called as i2c-fsi.
