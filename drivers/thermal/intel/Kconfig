	depends on CPU_SUP_INTEL
	help
	  Enable this to enable Intel PowerClamp idle injection driver. This
	  enforce idle time which results in more package C-state residency. The
	  user interface is exposed via generic thermal framework.

	  Enable this to register CPU digital sensor for package temperature as
	  thermal zone. Each package will have its own thermal zone. There are
	  two trip points which can be set by user to get notifications via thermal
	  notification methods.

	help
	  This is becoming a common feature for Intel SoCs to expose the additional
	  digital temperature sensors (DTSs) using side band interface (IOSF). This
	  implements the common set of helper functions to register, get temperature
	  and get/set thresholds on DTSs.

	select INTEL_SOC_DTS_IOSF_CORE
	select THERMAL_WRITABLE_TRIPS
	help
	  Enable this to register Intel SoCs (e.g. Bay Trail) platform digital
	  temperature sensor (DTS). These SoCs have two additional DTSs in
	  addition to DTSs on CPU cores. Each DTS will be registered as a
	  thermal zone. There are two trip points. One of the trip point can
	  be set by user mode programs to get notifications via Linux thermal
	  notification methods.The other trip is a critical trip point, which
	  was set by the driver based on the TJ MAX temperature.

config INTEL_QUARK_DTS_THERMAL

	depends on X86_INTEL_QUARK
	help
	  Enable this to register Intel Quark SoC (e.g. X1000) platform digital
	  temperature sensor (DTS). For X1000 SoC, it has one on-die DTS.
	  The DTS will be registered as a thermal zone. There are two trip points:
	  hot & critical. The critical trip point default value is set by
	  underlying BIOS/Firmware.

	  Select this driver for Intel Broxton PMIC with ADC channels monitoring
	  system temperature measurements and alerts.
	  This driver is used for monitoring the ADC channels of PMIC and handles
	  the alert trip point interrupts and notifies the thermal framework with
	  the trip point and temperature details of the zone.

config INTEL_PCH_THERMAL

	help
	  Enable this to support thermal reporting on certain intel PCHs.
	  Thermal reporting device will provide temperature reading,
	  programmable trip points and other information.

config INTEL_TCC_COOLING

	depends on X86
	help
	  Enable this to support system cooling by adjusting the effective TCC
	  activation temperature via the TCC Offset register, which is widely
	  supported on modern Intel platforms.
	  Note that, on different platforms, the behavior might be different
	  on how fast the setting takes effect, and how much the CPU frequency
	  is reduced.
