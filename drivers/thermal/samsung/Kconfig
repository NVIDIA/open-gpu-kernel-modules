	  If you say yes here you get support for the TMU (Thermal Management
	  Unit) driver for Samsung Exynos series of SoCs. This driver initialises
	  the TMU, reports temperature and handles cooling action if defined.
	  This driver uses the Exynos core thermal APIs and TMU configuration
	  data from the supported SoCs.
