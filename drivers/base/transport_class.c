 * transport_class.c - implementation of generic transport classes
 *                     using attribute_containers
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2005 - James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@steeleye.com>
 *
 * The basic idea here is to allow any "device controller" (which
 * would most often be a Host Bus Adapter to use the services of one
 * or more tranport classes for performing transport specific
 * services.  Transport specific services are things that the generic
 * command layer doesn't want to know about (speed settings, line
 * condidtioning, etc), but which the user might be interested in.
 * Thus, the HBA's use the routines exported by the transport classes
 * to perform these functions.  The transport classes export certain
 * values to the user via sysfs using attribute containers.
 *
 * Note: because not every HBA will care about every transport
 * attribute, there's a many to one relationship that goes like this:
 *
 * transport class<-----attribute container<----class device
 *
 * Usually the attribute container is per-HBA, but the design doesn't
 * mandate that.  Although most of the services will be specific to
 * the actual external storage connection used by the HBA, the generic
 * transport class is framed entirely in terms of generic devices to
 * allow it to be used by any physical HBA in the system.
