	  This enabled target side support for the NVMe protocol, that is
	  it allows the Linux kernel to implement NVMe subsystems and
	  controllers and export Linux block devices as NVMe namespaces.
	  You need to select at least one of the transports below to make this
	  functionality useful.

	  To configure the NVMe target you probably want to use the nvmetcli
	  tool from http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/nvmetcli.git.

	  This enables target side NVMe passthru controller support for the
	  NVMe Over Fabrics protocol. It allows for hosts to manage and
	  directly access an actual NVMe controller residing on the target
	  side, including executing Vendor Unique Commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This enables the NVMe loopback device support, which can be useful
	  to test NVMe host and target side features.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  This enables the NVMe RDMA target support, which allows exporting NVMe
	  devices over RDMA.

	  If unsure, say N.
