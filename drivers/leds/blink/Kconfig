         This option enables support for LEDs connected to GPIO lines on
         Lightning Mountain (LGM) SoC. Lightning Mountain is a AnyWAN
         gateway-on-a-chip SoC to be shipped on mid and high end home
         gateways and routers.

         These LEDs are driven by a Serial Shift Output (SSO) controller.
         The driver supports hardware blinking and the LEDs can be configured
         to be triggered by software/CPU or by hardware.

         Say 'Y' here if you are working on LGM SoC based platform. Otherwise,
         say 'N'. To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
         will be called leds-lgm-sso.
