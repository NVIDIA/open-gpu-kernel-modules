	  Unlike KDB's disable_nmi command, with this driver you are always
	  able to go back to the debugger using KGDB escape sequence ($3#33).
	  This is because this console driver processes the input in NMI
	  context, and thus is able to intercept the magic sequence.

	  Note that since the console interprets input and uses polling
	  communication methods, for things like PPP you still must fully
	  detach debugger port from the KGDB NMI (i.e. disable_nmi), and
	  use raw console.
