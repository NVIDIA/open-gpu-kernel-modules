	  Enable support for digital audio processing capability.

	  This module may be used for special applications that require
	  cross connecting of bchannels, conferencing, dtmf decoding,
	  echo cancellation, tone generation, and Blowfish encryption and
	  decryption. It may use hardware features if available.

	  E.g. it is required for PBX4Linux. Go to http://isdn.eversberg.eu
	  and get more information about this module and its usage.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.
