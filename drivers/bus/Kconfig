config BRCMSTB_GISB_ARB
	bool "Broadcom STB GISB bus arbiter"
	depends on ARM || ARM64 || MIPS
	default ARCH_BRCMSTB || BMIPS_GENERIC
	help
	  Driver for the Broadcom Set Top Box System-on-a-chip internal bus
	  arbiter. This driver provides timeout and target abort error handling
	  and internal bus master decoding.

config BT1_APB
	bool "Baikal-T1 APB-bus driver"
	depends on MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 || COMPILE_TEST
	select REGMAP_MMIO
	help
	  Baikal-T1 AXI-APB bridge is used to access the SoC subsystem CSRs.
	  IO requests are routed to this bus by means of the DW AMBA 3 AXI
	  Interconnect. In case of any APB protocol collisions, slave device
	  not responding on timeout an IRQ is raised with an erroneous address
	  reported to the APB terminator (APB Errors Handler Block). This
	  driver provides the interrupt handler to detect the erroneous
	  address, prints an error message about the address fault, updates an
	  errors counter. The counter and the APB-bus operations timeout can be
	  accessed via corresponding sysfs nodes.

config BT1_AXI
	bool "Baikal-T1 AXI-bus driver"
	depends on MIPS_BAIKAL_T1 || COMPILE_TEST
	select MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  AXI3-bus is the main communication bus connecting all high-speed
	  peripheral IP-cores with RAM controller and with MIPS P5600 cores on
	  Baikal-T1 SoC. Traffic arbitration is done by means of DW AMBA 3 AXI
	  Interconnect (so called AXI Main Interconnect) routing IO requests
	  from one SoC block to another. This driver provides a way to detect
	  any bus protocol errors and device not responding situations by
	  means of an embedded on top of the interconnect errors handler
	  block (EHB). AXI Interconnect QoS arbitration tuning is currently
	  unsupported.

config MOXTET
	tristate "CZ.NIC Turris Mox module configuration bus"
	depends on SPI_MASTER && OF
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the module configuration bus found
	  on CZ.NIC's Turris Mox. This is needed for the ability to discover
	  the order in which the modules are connected and to get/set some of
	  their settings. For example the GPIOs on Mox SFP module are
	  configured through this bus.

config HISILICON_LPC
	bool "Support for ISA I/O space on HiSilicon Hip06/7"

config IMX_WEIM
	bool "Freescale EIM DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Driver for i.MX WEIM controller.
	  The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
	  You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

config MIPS_CDMM
	bool "MIPS Common Device Memory Map (CDMM) Driver"
	depends on CPU_MIPSR2 || CPU_MIPSR5
	help
	  Driver needed for the MIPS Common Device Memory Map bus in MIPS
	  cores. This bus is for per-CPU tightly coupled devices such as the
	  Fast Debug Channel (FDC).

	  For this to work, either your bootloader needs to enable the CDMM
	  region at an unused physical address on the boot CPU, or else your
	  platform code needs to implement mips_cdmm_phys_base() (see
	  asm/cdmm.h).

config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	help
	  Driver needed for the MBus configuration on Marvell EBU SoCs
	  (Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x, MV78XX0 and Armada 370/XP).

	  Driver to enable OMAP interconnect error handling driver.

config OMAP_OCP2SCP
	tristate "OMAP OCP2SCP DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Driver to enable ocp2scp module which transforms ocp interface
	  protocol to scp protocol. In OMAP4, USB PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP and in OMAP5, both USB PHY and SATA PHY is connected via

	tristate "Simple Power-Managed Bus Driver"
	depends on OF && PM
	help
	  Driver for transparent busses that don't need a real driver, but
	  where the bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control
	  of a functional clock, and thus relies on runtime PM for managing
	  this PM domain and/or clock.
	  An example of such a bus controller is the Renesas Bus State
	  Controller (BSC, sometimes called "LBSC within Bus Bridge", or
	  "External Bus Interface") as found on several Renesas ARM SoCs.

	  default ARM64
	  depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	  select SUNXI_SRAM
	  help
