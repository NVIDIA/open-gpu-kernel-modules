/**
 * DOC: frontbuffer tracking
 *
 * Many features require us to track changes to the currently active
 * frontbuffer, especially rendering targeted at the frontbuffer.
 *
 * To be able to do so we track frontbuffers using a bitmask for all possible
 * frontbuffer slots through intel_frontbuffer_track(). The functions in this
 * file are then called when the contents of the frontbuffer are invalidated,
 * when frontbuffer rendering has stopped again to flush out all the changes
 * and when the frontbuffer is exchanged with a flip. Subsystems interested in
 * frontbuffer changes (e.g. PSR, FBC, DRRS) should directly put their callbacks
 * into the relevant places and filter for the frontbuffer slots that they are
 * interested int.
 *
 * On a high level there are two types of powersaving features. The first one
 * work like a special cache (FBC and PSR) and are interested when they should
 * stop caching and when to restart caching. This is done by placing callbacks
 * into the invalidate and the flush functions: At invalidate the caching must
 * be stopped and at flush time it can be restarted. And maybe they need to know
 * when the frontbuffer changes (e.g. when the hw doesn't initiate an invalidate
 * and flush on its own) which can be achieved with placing callbacks into the
 * flip functions.
 *
 * The other type of display power saving feature only cares about busyness
 * (e.g. DRRS). In that case all three (invalidate, flush and flip) indicate
 * busyness. There is no direct way to detect idleness. Instead an idle timer
 * work delayed work should be started from the flush and flip functions and
 * cancelled as soon as busyness is detected.
