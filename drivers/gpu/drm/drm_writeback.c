/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * Writeback connectors are used to expose hardware which can write the output
 * from a CRTC to a memory buffer. They are used and act similarly to other
 * types of connectors, with some important differences:
 *
 * * Writeback connectors don't provide a way to output visually to the user.
 *
 * * Writeback connectors are visible to userspace only when the client sets
 *   DRM_CLIENT_CAP_WRITEBACK_CONNECTORS.
 *
 * * Writeback connectors don't have EDID.
 *
 * A framebuffer may only be attached to a writeback connector when the
 * connector is attached to a CRTC. The WRITEBACK_FB_ID property which sets the
 * framebuffer applies only to a single commit (see below). A framebuffer may
 * not be attached while the CRTC is off.
 *
 * Unlike with planes, when a writeback framebuffer is removed by userspace DRM
 * makes no attempt to remove it from active use by the connector. This is
 * because no method is provided to abort a writeback operation, and in any
 * case making a new commit whilst a writeback is ongoing is undefined (see
 * WRITEBACK_OUT_FENCE_PTR below). As soon as the current writeback is finished,
 * the framebuffer will automatically no longer be in active use. As it will
 * also have already been removed from the framebuffer list, there will be no
 * way for any userspace application to retrieve a reference to it in the
 * intervening period.
 *
 * Writeback connectors have some additional properties, which userspace
 * can use to query and control them:
 *
 *  "WRITEBACK_FB_ID":
 *	Write-only object property storing a DRM_MODE_OBJECT_FB: it stores the
 *	framebuffer to be written by the writeback connector. This property is
 *	similar to the FB_ID property on planes, but will always read as zero
 *	and is not preserved across commits.
 *	Userspace must set this property to an output buffer every time it
 *	wishes the buffer to get filled.
 *
 *  "WRITEBACK_PIXEL_FORMATS":
 *	Immutable blob property to store the supported pixel formats table. The
 *	data is an array of u32 DRM_FORMAT_* fourcc values.
 *	Userspace can use this blob to find out what pixel formats are supported
 *	by the connector's writeback engine.
 *
 *  "WRITEBACK_OUT_FENCE_PTR":
 *	Userspace can use this property to provide a pointer for the kernel to
 *	fill with a sync_file file descriptor, which will signal once the
 *	writeback is finished. The value should be the address of a 32-bit
 *	signed integer, cast to a u64.
 *	Userspace should wait for this fence to signal before making another
 *	commit affecting any of the same CRTCs, Planes or Connectors.
 *	**Failure to do so will result in undefined behaviour.**
 *	For this reason it is strongly recommended that all userspace
 *	applications making use of writeback connectors *always* retrieve an
 *	out-fence for the commit and use it appropriately.
 *	From userspace, this property will always read as zero.
