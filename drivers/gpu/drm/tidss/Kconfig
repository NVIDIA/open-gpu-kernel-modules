	  The TI Keystone family SoCs introduced a new generation of
	  Display SubSystem. There is currently three Keystone family
	  SoCs released with DSS. Each with somewhat different version
	  of it. The SoCs are 66AK2Gx, AM65x, and J721E. Set this to Y
	  or M to add display support for TI Keystone family
	  platforms.
