/*
 * KFD Interrupts.
 *
 * AMD GPUs deliver interrupts by pushing an interrupt description onto the
 * interrupt ring and then sending an interrupt. KGD receives the interrupt
 * in ISR and sends us a pointer to each new entry on the interrupt ring.
 *
 * We generally can't process interrupt-signaled events from ISR, so we call
 * out to each interrupt client module (currently only the scheduler) to ask if
 * each interrupt is interesting. If they return true, then it requires further
 * processing so we copy it to an internal interrupt ring and call each
 * interrupt client again from a work-queue.
 *
 * There's no acknowledgment for the interrupts we use. The hardware simply
 * queues a new interrupt each time without waiting.
 *
 * The fixed-size internal queue means that it's possible for us to lose
 * interrupts because we have no back-pressure to the hardware.
