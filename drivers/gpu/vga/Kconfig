	  Some "legacy" VGA devices implemented on PCI typically have the same
	  hard-decoded addresses as they did on ISA. When multiple PCI devices
	  are accessed at same time they need some kind of coordination. Please
	  see Documentation/gpu/vgaarbiter.rst for more details. Select this to

	  Many laptops released in 2008/9/10 have two GPUs with a multiplexer
	  to switch between them. This adds support for dynamic switching when
	  X isn't running and delayed switching until the next logoff. This
	  feature is called hybrid graphics, ATI PowerXpress, and Nvidia
	  HybridPower.
