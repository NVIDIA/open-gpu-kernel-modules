	  Support for PCI cards based on the Pluto2 FPGA like the Satelco
	  Easywatch Mobile Terrestrial DVB-T Receiver.

	  Since these cards have no MPEG decoder onboard, they transmit
	  only compressed MPEG data over the PCI bus, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV on your computer.

	  Say Y or M if you own such a device and want to use it.
