	help
	   Configuring the media subsystem can be complex, as there are
	   hundreds of drivers and other config options.

	   This menu offers option that will help the Kernel's config
	   system to hide drivers that are out of the scope of the
	   user needs, and disabling core support for unused APIs.

	   If not selected, all non-optional media core functionality
	   needed to support media drivers will be enabled. Also, all
	   media device drivers should be shown.

config MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT

	default y if MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER
	help
	  By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary
	  devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and
	  frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size,
	  like on embedded systems.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which
	  are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed
	  functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have
	  the needed demodulators).

	  If unsure say Y.

config MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT
	bool

	  Enable analog TV support.

	  Say Y when you have a TV board with analog support or with a

	  Note: There are several DVB cards that are based on chips that
		support both analog and digital TV. Disabling this option
		will disable support for them.

config MEDIA_DIGITAL_TV_SUPPORT
	bool

config MEDIA_RADIO_SUPPORT

	  Say Y when you have a board with radio support.

	  Note: There are several TV cards that are based on chips that

		disable support for them.

config MEDIA_SDR_SUPPORT
	bool

	help
	  Enable support for complex cameras, codecs, and other hardware
	  that are integrated at the CPU, GPU or on Image Signalling Processor
	  and don't use PCI, USB or Firewire buses.

	  This is found on Embedded hardware (SoC), on V4L2 codecs and
	  on some GPU and newer CPU chipsets.

	  Say Y when you want to be able to see such devices.

config MEDIA_TEST_SUPPORT
	bool
	prompt "Test drivers" if MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER
	default y if !MEDIA_SUPPORT_FILTER
	help
	  Those drivers should not be used on production Kernels, but
	  can be useful on debug ones. It enables several dummy drivers
	  that simulate a real hardware. Very useful to test userspace
	  applications and to validate if the subsystem core is doesn't
	  have regressions.

	  Say Y if you want to use some virtual test driver.

	  In case of doubts, say N.
	  Say Y when you have a software defined radio device.
