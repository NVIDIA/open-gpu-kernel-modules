	  Support for external USB adapters designed by Technotrend and
	  produced by Hauppauge, shipped under the brand name 'DEC2000-t'
	  and 'DEC3000-s'.

	  Even if these devices have a MPEG decoder built in, they transmit
	  only compressed MPEG data over the USB bus, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV on your computer.

	  This driver needs external firmware. Please use the commands
	  "<kerneldir>/scripts/get_dvb_firmware dec2000t",
	  "<kerneldir>/scripts/get_dvb_firmware dec2540t",
	  "<kerneldir>/scripts/get_dvb_firmware dec3000s",
	  download/extract them, and then copy them to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
	  or /lib/firmware (depending on configuration of firmware hotplug).

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
