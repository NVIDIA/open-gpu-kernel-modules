	  The PCA635, PCVC665 and PCVC720/20 are not supported by this driver
	  and never will be, but the 665 and 720/20 are supported by other
	  drivers.

	  Some newer logitech webcams are not handled by this driver but by the
	  Usb Video Class driver (linux-uvc).

	  The built-in microphone is enabled by selecting USB Audio support.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pwc.

	help
	  Say Y here in order to have the pwc driver generate verbose debugging
	  messages.

config USB_PWC_INPUT_EVDEV
	bool "USB Philips Cameras input events device support"
	default y
	depends on USB_PWC && (USB_PWC=INPUT || INPUT=y)
	help
	  This option makes USB Philips cameras register the snapshot button as
	  an input device to report button events.

	  If you are in doubt, say Y.
