	  _Professional_, which has not been tested with this driver,
	  but uses the same sensor and may therefore work.

	  This driver creates an entry "/dev/idmouseX" or "/dev/usb/idmouseX",
	  which can be used by, e.g.,"cat /dev/idmouse0 > fingerprint.pnm".

	  See also <https://www.fs.tum.de/~echtler/idmouse/>.

config USB_FTDI_ELAN
	tristate "Elan PCMCIA CardBus Adapter USB Client"
	help
	  ELAN's Uxxx series of adapters are USB to PCMCIA CardBus adapters.
	  Currently only the U132 adapter is available.

	  The U132 is specifically designed for CardBus PC cards that contain
	  an OHCI host controller. Typical PC cards are the Orange Mobile 3G
	  Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card. The U132 adapter will *NOT* work
	  with PC cards that do not contain an OHCI controller. To use a U132
	  adapter you will need this "ftdi-elan" module as well as the "u132-hcd"
	  module which is a USB host controller driver that talks to the OHCI
	  controller within CardBus card that are inserted in the U132 adapter.

	  This driver has been tested with a CardBus OHCI USB adapter, and
	  worked with a USB PEN Drive inserted into the first USB port of
	  the PCCARD. A rather pointless thing to do, but useful for testing.

	  See also the USB_U132_HCD entry "Elan U132 Adapter Host Controller"

	  It is safe to say M here.
