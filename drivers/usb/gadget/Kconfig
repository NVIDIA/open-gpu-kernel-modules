	help
	   USB is a host/device protocol, organized with one host (such as a
	   PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and
	   the kernel documentation for this API.

config USB_GADGET_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging messages (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	   Many controller and gadget drivers will print some debugging
	   messages if you use this option to ask for those messages.

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively
	   debugging such a driver.  Many drivers will emit so many
	   messages that the driver timings are affected, which will
	   either create new failure modes or remove the one you're
	   trying to track down.  Never enable these messages for a
	   production build.

config USB_GADGET_VERBOSE
	bool "Verbose debugging Messages (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on USB_GADGET_DEBUG
	help
	   Many controller and gadget drivers will print verbose debugging
	   messages if you use this option to ask for those messages.

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively
	   debugging such a driver.  Many drivers will emit so many
	   messages that the driver timings are affected, which will
	   either create new failure modes or remove the one you're
	   trying to track down.  Never enable these messages for a
	   production build.

config USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES
	bool "Debugging information files (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	   Some of the drivers in the "gadget" framework can expose
	   debugging information in files such as /proc/driver/udc
	   (for a peripheral controller).  The information in these
	   files may help when you're troubleshooting or bringing up a
	   driver on a new board.   Enable these files by choosing "Y"
	   here.  If in doubt, or to conserve kernel memory, say "N".

config USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Debugging information files in debugfs (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	   Some of the drivers in the "gadget" framework can expose
	   debugging information in files under /sys/kernel/debug/.
	   The information in these files may help when you're
	   troubleshooting or bringing up a driver on a new board.
	   Enable these files by choosing "Y" here.  If in doubt, or
	   to conserve kernel memory, say "N".

config USB_GADGET_VBUS_DRAW
	int "Maximum VBUS Power usage (2-500 mA)"
	range 2 500
	default 2
	help
	   Some devices need to draw power from USB when they are
	   configured, perhaps to operate circuitry or to recharge
	   batteries.  This is in addition to any local power supply,
	   such as an AC adapter or batteries.

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;
	   0 mA would be legal, but can make some hosts misbehave.

	   This value will be used except for system-specific gadget
	   drivers that have more specific information.

config USB_GADGET_STORAGE_NUM_BUFFERS
	int "Number of storage pipeline buffers"
	range 2 256
	default 2
	help
	   Usually 2 buffers are enough to establish a good buffering
	   pipeline. The number may be increased in order to compensate
	   for a bursty VFS behaviour. For instance there may be CPU wake up
	   latencies that makes the VFS to appear bursty in a system with
	   an CPU on-demand governor. Especially if DMA is doing IO to
	   offload the CPU. In this case the CPU will go into power
	   save often and spin up occasionally to move data within VFS.
	   If selecting USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES this value may be set by
	   a module parameter as well.
	   If unsure, say 2.

config U_SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool "Serial gadget console support"
	depends on USB_U_SERIAL
	help
	   It supports the serial gadget can be used as a console.

	  If this is the case, the USB functions (which from the host's
	  perspective are seen as interfaces) and configurations are
	  specified simply by creating appropriate directories in configfs.
	  Associating functions with configurations is done by creating

	   To make MS-Windows work with this, use Documentation/usb/linux.inf

	help
	  CDC EEM is a newer USB standard that is somewhat simpler than CDC ECM
	  and therefore can be supported by more hardware.  Technically ECM and
	  EEM are designed for different applications.  The ECM model extends
	  the network interface to the target (e.g. a USB cable modem), and the
	  EEM model is for mobile devices to communicate with hosts using
	  ethernet over USB.  For Linux gadgets, however, the interface with

	  The Mass Storage Gadget acts as a USB Mass Storage disk drive.

	  Loopback function loops back a configurable number of transfers.
	  Sourcesink function either sinks and sources bulk data.
	  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9" conformance.
	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
