config USB_MDC800
	tristate "USB Mustek MDC800 Digital Camera support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect this type of still camera to
	  your computer's USB port. This driver can be used with gphoto 0.4.3
	  and higher (look at <http://www.gphoto.org/>).
	  To use it create a device node with "mknod /dev/mustek c 180 32" and
	  configure it in your software.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mdc800.

config USB_MICROTEK
	tristate "Microtek X6USB scanner support"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the Microtek X6USB and
	  possibly the Phantom 336CX, Phantom C6 and ScanMaker V6U(S)L.
	  Support for anything but the X6 is experimental.
	  Please report failures and successes.
	  The scanner will appear as a scsi generic device to the rest
	  of the system. Scsi support is required.
	  This driver can be compiled as a module, called microtek.
