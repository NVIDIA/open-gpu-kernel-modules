config USB_SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool "USB Serial Console device support"
	depends on USB_SERIAL=y
	help
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a USB to serial
	  converter port as the system console (the system console is the
	  device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which
	  allows logins in single user mode). This could be useful if some
	  terminal or printer is connected to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyUSB0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
