	  Say Y here if your system has a Dual Role Hi-Speed USB
	  controller based on the DesignWare HSOTG IP Core.

	  For host mode, if you choose to build the driver as dynamically
	  linked modules, the core module will be called dwc2.ko, the PCI
	  bus interface module (if you have a PCI bus system) will be
	  called dwc2_pci.ko, and the platform interface module (for
	  controllers directly connected to the CPU) will be called
	  dwc2_platform.ko. For all modes(host, gadget and dual-role), there
	  will be an additional module named dwc2.ko.
