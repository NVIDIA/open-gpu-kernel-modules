	  This option enables the SoC Controller Driver which verifies
	  LiteX CSR access and provides common litex_[read|write]*
	  accessors.

	LiteX MMIO registers (referred to as Configuration and Status
	registers, or CSRs) are spread across adjacent 8- or 32-bit
	subregisters, located at 32-bit aligned MMIO addresses. Use
	this to select the appropriate size (1 or 4 bytes) matching
	your particular LiteX build.
