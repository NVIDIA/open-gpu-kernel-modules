	  The General Register Files are a central component providing
	  special additional settings registers for a lot of soc-components.
	  In a lot of cases there also need to be default settings initialized
	  to make some of them conform to expectations of the kernel.

	help
	  Say y here to enable support io domains on Rockchip SoCs. It is
	  necessary for the io domain setting of the SoC to match the
	  voltage supplied by the regulators.

          Say y here to enable power domain support.
          In order to meet high performance and low power requirements, a power
          management unit is designed or saving power when RK3288 in low power
          mode. The RK3288 PMU is dedicated for managing the power of the whole chip.

          If unsure, say N.
