 * Here's a high level overview of how all the registers in RPMH work
 * together:
 *
 * - The main rpmh-rsc address is the base of a register space that can
 *   be used to find overall configuration of the hardware
 *   (DRV_PRNT_CHLD_CONFIG). Also found within the rpmh-rsc register
 *   space are all the TCS blocks. The offset of the TCS blocks is
 *   specified in the device tree by "qcom,tcs-offset" and used to
 *   compute tcs_base.
 * - TCS blocks come one after another. Type, count, and order are
 *   specified by the device tree as "qcom,tcs-config".
 * - Each TCS block has some registers, then space for up to 16 commands.
 *   Note that though address space is reserved for 16 commands, fewer
 *   might be present. See ncpt (num cmds per TCS).
 *
