	help
	  Generic Voltage and Current Regulator support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to voltage
	  and current regulators within the Linux kernel. It's intended to
	  provide voltage and current control to client or consumer drivers and
	  also provide status information to user space applications through a
	  sysfs interface.

	  The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator
	  output in order to save power and prolong battery life. This applies
	  to both voltage regulators (where voltage output is controllable) and
	  current sinks (where current output is controllable).

	  This framework safely compiles out if not selected so that client
	  drivers can still be used in systems with no software controllable
	  regulators.

	  If unsure, say no.
