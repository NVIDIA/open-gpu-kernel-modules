	  This module contains the main code for Inside Secure microread
	  NFC chipsets. It implements the chipset HCI logic and hooks into
	  the NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will register against it.

	select NFC_MICROREAD
	help
	  This module adds support for the i2c interface of adapters using
	  Inside microread chipsets.  Select this if your platform is using
	  the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called microread_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.

	select NFC_MICROREAD
	help
	  This module adds support for the mei interface of adapters using
	  Inside microread chipsets.  Select this if your microread chipset
	  is handled by Intel's Management Engine Interface on your platform.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called microread_mei.
	  Say N if unsure.
