	  This driver adds support for the PCC interface.

	  For details, take a look at:
	  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq_drivers.rst>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.
	  This driver also supports Intel Enhanced Speedstep and newer
	  AMD CPUs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called acpi-cpufreq.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	default y
	bool "Legacy cpb sysfs knob support for AMD CPUs"
	depends on X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ && CPU_SUP_AMD
	help
	  The powernow-k8 driver used to provide a sysfs knob called "cpb"
	  to disable the Core Performance Boosting feature of AMD CPUs. This
	  file has now been superseded by the more generic "boost" entry.

	  By enabling this option the acpi_cpufreq driver provides the old
	  entry in addition to the new boost ones, for compatibility reasons.

config ELAN_CPUFREQ
	tristate "AMD Elan SC400 and SC410"
	depends on MELAN
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for AMD Elan SC400 and SC410
	  processors.

	  You need to specify the processor maximum speed as boot
	  parameter: elanfreq=maxspeed (in kHz) or as module
	  parameter "max_freq".

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_POWERNOW_K7

	tristate "AMD frequency sensitivity feedback powersave bias"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND && X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ && CPU_SUP_AMD
	help
	  This adds AMD-specific powersave bias function to the ondemand
	  governor, which allows it to make more power-conscious frequency
	  change decisions based on feedback from hardware (available on AMD
	  Family 16h and above).

	  Hardware feedback tells software how "sensitive" to frequency changes
	  the CPUs' workloads are. CPU-bound workloads will be more sensitive
	  -- they will perform better as frequency increases. Memory/IO-bound
	  workloads will be less sensitive -- they will not necessarily perform
	  better as frequency increases.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_GX_SUSPMOD
	tristate "Cyrix MediaGX/NatSemi Geode Suspend Modulation"
	depends on X86_32 && PCI

	help
	  This is deprecated and this functionality is now merged into
	  acpi_cpufreq (X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ). Use that driver instead of
	  speedstep_centrino.
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called speedstep-centrino.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH
	tristate "Intel Speedstep on ICH-M chipsets (ioport interface)"
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for certain mobile Intel Pentium III

	  on systems which have an Intel 440BX/ZX/MX southbridge.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
	tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Intel Pentium 4 / XEON
	  processors.  When enabled it will lower CPU temperature by skipping
	  clocks.

	  This driver should be only used in exceptional
	  circumstances when very low power is needed because it causes severe
	  slowdowns and noticeable latencies.  Normally Speedstep should be used
	  instead.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called p4-clockmod.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  Unless you are absolutely sure say N.

config X86_CPUFREQ_NFORCE2

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_LONGHAUL
	tristate "VIA Cyrix III Longhaul"
	depends on X86_32 && ACPI_PROCESSOR

config X86_E_POWERSAVER
	tristate "VIA C7 Enhanced PowerSaver (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on X86_32 && ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for VIA C7 processors.  However, this driver
	  does not have any safeguards to prevent operating the CPU out of spec
	  and is thus considered dangerous.  Please use the regular ACPI cpufreq
	  driver, enabled by CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	bool "Relaxed speedstep capability checks"
	depends on X86_32 && (X86_SPEEDSTEP_SMI || X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH)
	help
	  Don't perform all checks for a speedstep capable system which would
	  normally be done. Some ancient or strange systems, though speedstep
	  capable, don't always indicate that they are speedstep capable. This
	  option lets the probing code bypass some of those checks if the
	  parameter "relaxed_check=1" is passed to the module.
