	  This option provides support for the IndustryPack framework.  There
	  are IndustryPack carrier boards, which interface another bus (such as
	  PCI) to an IndustryPack bus, and IndustryPack modules, that are
	  hosted on these buses.  While IndustryPack modules can provide a
	  large variety of functionality, they are most often found in
	  industrial control applications.

	  Say N if unsure.
