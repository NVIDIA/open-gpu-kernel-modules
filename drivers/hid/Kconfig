	tristate "HID bus support"
	depends on INPUT
	default y
	help
	  A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
	  interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
	  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
	  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
	  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
	  mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus to the kernel,
	  together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added and
	  removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as
	  usbhid (USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).

	  For docs and specs, see https://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/

	  If unsure, say Y.

	select POWER_SUPPLY
	default n
	help
	This option adds support of reporting battery strength (for HID devices
	that support this feature) through power_supply class so that userspace
	tools, such as upower, can display it.

config HIDRAW
	bool "/dev/hidraw raw HID device support"
	depends on HID
	help
	Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptible Power Supplies.

	This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	event interface on /dev/hidraw.

	There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID
	configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process
	the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications
	to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific
	userspace libhid/libusb libraries.

	If unsure, say Y.

config UHID
	tristate "User-space I/O driver support for HID subsystem"
	depends on HID
	default n
	help
	Say Y here if you want to provide HID I/O Drivers from user-space.
	This allows to write I/O drivers in user-space and feed the data from
	the device into the kernel. The kernel parses the HID reports, loads the
	corresponding HID Device Driver or provides input devices on top of your
	user-space device.

	This driver cannot be used to parse HID-reports in user-space and write
	special HID-drivers. You should use hidraw for that.
	Instead, this driver allows to write the transport-layer driver in
	user-space like USB-HID and Bluetooth-HID do in kernel-space.

	If unsure, say N.

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	module will be called uhid.

config HID_GENERIC
