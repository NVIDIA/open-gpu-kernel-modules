	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  AMD Sensor Fusion Hub.
	  This driver will enable sensors functionality on AMD platforms
	  starting from 17h family of RYZEN parts.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will
	  be called amd-sfh.
	  Say Y or M here if you want to support AMD SFH. If unsure, say N.
