	  There are two drivers for Serial ATA controllers.

	  The main driver, "libata", uses the SCSI subsystem
	  and supports most modern SATA controllers. In order to use it
	  you may take a look at "Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA
	  (experimental) drivers".

	  The IDE driver (which you are currently configuring) supports
	  a few first-generation SATA controllers.

	  In order to eliminate conflicts between the two subsystems,
	  this config option enables the IDE driver's SATA support.

	  and the controller is located at legacy ports, this driver
	  may grab those ports and thus can prevent the controller
	  specific driver from attaching.

	  Also, currently, IDE generic doesn't allow IRQ sharing
	  meaning that the IRQs it grabs won't be available to other

config BLK_DEV_GAYLE
	tristate "Amiga Gayle IDE interface support"
	depends on AMIGA
	help
	  This is the IDE driver for the Amiga Gayle IDE interface. It supports
	  both the `A1200 style' and `A4000 style' of the Gayle IDE interface,
	  This includes on-board IDE interfaces on some Amiga models (A600,
	  A1200, A4000, and A4000T), and IDE interfaces on the Zorro expansion
	  bus (M-Tech E-Matrix 530 expansion card).

	  It also provides support for the so-called `IDE doublers' (made
	  by various manufacturers, e.g. Eyetech) that can be connected to
	  the on-board IDE interface of some Amiga models. Using such an IDE
	  doubler, you can connect up to four instead of two IDE devices to
	  the Amiga's on-board IDE interface. The feature is enabled at kernel
	  runtime using the "gayle.doubler" kernel boot parameter.

	  Say Y if you have an Amiga with a Gayle IDE interface and want to use
	  IDE devices (hard disks, CD-ROM drives, etc.) that are connected to
	  it.

	  Note that you also have to enable Zorro bus support if you want to
	  use Gayle IDE interfaces on the Zorro expansion bus.
