menuconfig WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	help
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.rst> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WATCHDOG_CORE
	tristate "WatchDog Timer Driver Core"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the new watchdog timer driver core.
	  This driver provides a framework for all watchdog timer drivers
	  and gives them the /dev/watchdog interface (and later also the
	  sysfs interface).

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

config WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED
	bool "Update boot-enabled watchdog until userspace takes over"
	default y
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say Y here) is
	  to ping watchdog devices that were enabled before the driver has
	  been loaded until control is taken over from userspace using the
	  /dev/watchdog file. If you say N here, the kernel will not update
	  the watchdog on its own. Thus if your userspace does not start fast
	  enough your device will reboot.
