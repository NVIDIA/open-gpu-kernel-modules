/**
 * DOC: IPA/GSI Configuration Data
 *
 * Boot-time configuration data is used to define the configuration of the
 * IPA and GSI resources to use for a given platform.  This data is supplied
 * via the Device Tree match table, associated with a particular compatible
 * string.  The data defines information about how resources, endpoints and
 * channels, memory, clocking and so on are allocated and used for the
 * platform.
 *
 * Resources are data structures used internally by the IPA hardware.  The
 * configuration data defines the number (or limits of the number) of various
 * types of these resources.
 *
 * Endpoint configuration data defines properties of both IPA endpoints and
 * GSI channels.  A channel is a GSI construct, and represents a single
 * communication path between the IPA and a particular execution environment
 * (EE), such as the AP or Modem.  Each EE has a set of channels associated
 * with it, and each channel has an ID unique for that EE.  For the most part
 * the only GSI channels of concern to this driver belong to the AP
 *
 * An endpoint is an IPA construct representing a single channel anywhere
 * in the system.  An IPA endpoint ID maps directly to an (EE, channel_id)
 * pair.  Generally, this driver is concerned with only endpoints associated
 * with the AP, however this will change when support for routing (etc.) is
 * added.  IPA endpoint and GSI channel configuration data are defined
 * together, establishing the endpoint_id->(EE, channel_id) mapping.
 *
 * Endpoint configuration data consists of three parts:  properties that
 * are common to IPA and GSI (EE ID, channel ID, endpoint ID, and direction);
 * properties associated with the GSI channel; and properties associated with
 * the IPA endpoint.

 * A GSI channel is a unidirectional means of transferring data to or
 * from (and through) the IPA.  A GSI channel has a ring buffer made
 * up of "transfer ring elements" (TREs) that specify individual data
 * transfers or IPA immediate commands.  TREs are filled by the AP,
 * and control is passed to IPA hardware by writing the last written
 * element into a doorbell register.
 *
 * When data transfer commands have completed the GSI generates an
 * event (a structure of data) and optionally signals the AP with
 * an interrupt.  Event structures are implemented by another ring
 * buffer, directed toward the AP from the IPA.
 *
 * The input to a GSI channel is a FIFO of type/length/value (TLV)
 * elements, and the size of this FIFO limits the number of TREs
 * that can be included in a single transaction.
