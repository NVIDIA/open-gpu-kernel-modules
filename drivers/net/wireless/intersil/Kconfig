	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the

	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  This enables support for FullMAC PCI/Cardbus prism54 devices. This
	  driver is now deprecated in favor for the SoftMAC driver, p54pci.
	  p54pci supports FullMAC PCI/Cardbus devices as well.

	  For more information refer to the p54 wiki:

	  Note: You need a motherboard with DMA support to use any of these cards

	  When built as module you get the module prism54
