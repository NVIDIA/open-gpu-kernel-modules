	  This is the mainline driver for the Atheros "otus" 802.11n USB devices.

	  It needs a special firmware (carl9170-1.fw), which can be downloaded
	  from our wiki here:
	  <https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/carl9170>

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called carl9170.

	  Provides a hardware random number generator to the kernel.

	  generated random numbers from the transport stream with
	  usbmon [software] or special usb sniffer hardware.

	  Say N, unless your setup[i.e.: embedded system] has no
	  other rng source and you can afford to take the risk.
