	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about these cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y if you want to use wireless LAN adapters based on the ZyDAS
	  ZD1201 chip.

	  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface,
	  typically on wlan0.

	  The zd1201 device requires external firmware to be loaded.
	  This can be found at http://linux-lc100020.sourceforge.net/

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called zd1201.
