	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about these cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  one of these, you will need to provide a firmware image
	  to be loaded into the card by the driver. The Atmel
	  firmware package can be downloaded from
	  <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel>
