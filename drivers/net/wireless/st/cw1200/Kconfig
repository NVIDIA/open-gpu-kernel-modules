	  This is a driver for the ST-E CW1100 & CW1200 WLAN chipsets.
	  This option just enables the driver core, see below for
	  specific bus support.

	  Enable support for the CW1200 connected via an SDIO bus.
	  By default this driver only supports the Sagrad SG901-1091/1098 EVK
	  and similar designs that utilize a hardware reset circuit. To
	  support different CW1200 SDIO designs you will need to override
	  the default platform data by calling cw1200_sdio_set_platform_data()
	  in your board setup file.

config CW1200_WLAN_SPI
	tristate "Support SPI platforms"
	depends on CW1200 && SPI
	help
	  Enables support for the CW1200 connected via a SPI bus.  You will
	  need to add appropriate platform data glue in your board setup
	  file.
