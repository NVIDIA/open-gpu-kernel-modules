	default y
	depends on PCI
	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about D-Link devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_DLINK

config DL2K
	tristate "DL2000/TC902x/IP1000A-based Gigabit Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	help
	  This driver supports DL2000/TC902x/IP1000A-based Gigabit ethernet cards,
	  which includes
	  D-Link DGE-550T Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
	  D-Link DL2000-based Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
	  Sundance/Tamarack TC902x Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
	  ICPlus IP1000A-based cards

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dl2k.

config SUNDANCE
	tristate "Sundance Alta support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select MII
	help
	  This driver is for the Sundance "Alta" chip.
	  More specific information and updates are available from
	  <http://www.scyld.com/network/sundance.html>.

config SUNDANCE_MMIO
	bool "Use MMIO instead of PIO"
	depends on SUNDANCE
	help
	  Enable memory-mapped I/O for interaction with Sundance NIC registers.
	  Do NOT enable this by default, PIO (enabled when MMIO is disabled)
	  is known to solve bugs on certain chips.

	  If unsure, say N.
