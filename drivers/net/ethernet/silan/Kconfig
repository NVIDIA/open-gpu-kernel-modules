	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Silan devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	select CRC32
	help
	  This is a driver for the Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on
	  the Silan SC92031 chip (sometimes also called Rsltek 8139D). If you
	  have one of these, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called sc92031.  This is recommended.
