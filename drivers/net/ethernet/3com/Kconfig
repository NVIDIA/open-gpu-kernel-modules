	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about 3Com cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_3COM

config EL3
	tristate "3c509/3c579 \"EtherLink III\" support"
	depends on (ISA || EISA)
	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to the 3Com
	  EtherLinkIII series, say Y here.

	  If your card is not working you may need to use the DOS
	  setup disk to disable Plug & Play mode, and to select the default
	  media type.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c509.

config 3C515
	tristate "3c515 ISA \"Fast EtherLink\""
	depends on ISA && ISA_DMA_API && !PPC32
	help
	  If you have a 3Com ISA EtherLink XL "Corkscrew" 3c515 Fast Ethernet
	  network card, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called 3c515.

config PCMCIA_3C574
	tristate "3Com 3c574 PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a 3Com 3c574 or compatible PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) Fast Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called 3c574_cs.  If unsure, say N.

config PCMCIA_3C589
	tristate "3Com 3c589 PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a 3Com 3c589 or compatible PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called 3c589_cs.  If unsure, say N.

config VORTEX
	tristate "3c590/3c900 series (592/595/597) \"Vortex/Boomerang\" support"
	depends on (PCI || EISA) && HAS_IOPORT_MAP
	select MII
	help
	  This option enables driver support for a large number of 10Mbps and
	  10/100Mbps EISA, PCI and Cardbus 3Com network cards:

	  "Vortex"    (Fast EtherLink 3c590/3c592/3c595/3c597) EISA and PCI
	  "Boomerang" (EtherLink XL 3c900 or 3c905)            PCI
	  "Cyclone"   (3c540/3c900/3c905/3c980/3c575/3c656)    PCI and Cardbus

	  "Hurricane" (3c555/3cSOHO)                           PCI

	  If you have such a card, say Y here.  More specific information is in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/3com/vortex.rst>
	  and in the comments at the beginning of
	  <file:drivers/net/ethernet/3com/3c59x.c>.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here.

config TYPHOON
	tristate "3cr990 series \"Typhoon\" support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	help
	  This option enables driver support for the 3cr990 series of cards:

	  3C990-TX, 3CR990-TX-95, 3CR990-TX-97, 3CR990-FX-95, 3CR990-FX-97,

	  3CR990-FX-97 Server, 3C990B-TX-M, 3C990BSVR

	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called typhoon.
