	  Option to select ethernet drivers for Socionext platforms.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Socionext devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

	  Enable to add support for the SocioNext NetSec Gigabit Ethernet
	  controller + PHY, as found on the Synquacer SC2A11 SoC

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called netsec.  If unsure, say N.
