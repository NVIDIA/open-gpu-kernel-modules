	  If you have a network (Ethernet) device belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Synopsys devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific device in the following questions.

	  This driver supports the Synopsys DesignWare Cores Enterprise
	  Ethernet (dwc-xlgmac).

	depends on DWC_XLGMAC && PCI
	help
	  This selects the pci bus support for the dwc-xlgmac driver.
	  This driver was tested on Synopsys XLGMAC IP Prototyping Kit.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.
	  If unsure, say N.
