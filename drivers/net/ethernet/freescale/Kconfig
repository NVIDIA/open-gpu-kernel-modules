	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Freescale devices. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	  This option enables support for the MPC5200's on-chip

	help
	  The MPC5200's FEC can connect to the Ethernet either with
	  an external MII PHY chip or 10 Mbps 7-wire interface
	  (Motorola? industry standard).
	  If your board uses an external PHY connected to FEC, enable this.
	  If not sure, enable.
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx_phy.
