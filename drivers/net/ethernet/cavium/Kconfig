config THUNDER_NIC_PF
	tristate "Thunder Physical function driver"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	select THUNDER_NIC_BGX
	help
	  This driver supports Thunder's NIC physical function.
	  The NIC provides the controller and DMA engines to
	  move network traffic to/from the memory. The NIC
	  works closely with TNS, BGX and SerDes to implement the
	  functions replacing and virtualizing those of a typical
	  standalone PCIe NIC chip.

config THUNDER_NIC_VF
	tristate "Thunder Virtual function driver"
	imply CAVIUM_PTP
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	help
	  This driver supports Thunder's NIC virtual function

	tristate "Thunder MAC interface driver (BGX)"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	select PHYLIB
	select MDIO_THUNDER if PCI
	select THUNDER_NIC_RGX
	help
	  This driver supports programming and controlling of MAC
	  interface from NIC physical function driver.

config	THUNDER_NIC_RGX
	tristate "Thunder MAC interface driver (RGX)"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	select PHYLIB
	select MDIO_THUNDER if PCI
	help
	  This driver supports configuring XCV block of RGX interface
	  present on CN81XX chip.

config CAVIUM_PTP
	tristate "Cavium PTP coprocessor as PTP clock"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	help
	  This driver adds support for the Precision Time Protocol Clocks and
	  Timestamping coprocessor (PTP) found on Cavium processors.
	  PTP provides timestamping mechanism that is suitable for use in IEEE 1588
	  Precision Time Protocol or other purposes.  Timestamps can be used in
	  BGX, TNS, GTI, and NIC blocks.

	tristate "Cavium LiquidIO support"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI
	depends on PCI
	imply PTP_1588_CLOCK
	select FW_LOADER
	select LIBCRC32C
	select NET_DEVLINK
	help
	  This driver supports Cavium LiquidIO Intelligent Server Adapters
	  based on CN66XX, CN68XX and CN23XX chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called liquidio.  This is recommended.

config OCTEON_MGMT_ETHERNET
	tristate "Octeon Management port ethernet driver (CN5XXX, CN6XXX)"
	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC
	select PHYLIB
	select MDIO_OCTEON

	help
	  Enable the ethernet driver for the management
	  port on Cavium Networks' Octeon CN57XX, CN56XX, CN55XX,
	  CN54XX, CN52XX, and CN6XXX chips.

config LIQUIDIO_VF
	tristate "Cavium LiquidIO VF support"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI_MSI
	imply PTP_1588_CLOCK
	help
	  This driver supports Cavium LiquidIO Intelligent Server Adapter
	  based on CN23XX chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: The module
	  will be called liquidio_vf. MSI-X interrupt support is required
	  for this driver to work correctly
