	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about SMC/Western Digital cards. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	select CRC32
	help
	  This is support for the SMC9xxx based Ethernet cards. Choose this
	  option if you have a DELL laptop with the docking station, or
	  another SMC9192/9194 based chipset.  Say Y if you want it compiled
	  into the kernel, and read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/smsc/smc9.rst>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called smc9194.

	help
	  This is a driver for SMC's 91x series of Ethernet chipsets,
	  including the SMC91C94 and the SMC91C111. Say Y if you want it
	  compiled into the kernel, and read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/smsc/smc9.rst>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called smc91x.  If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.rst>.

config PCMCIA_SMC91C92

	select CRC32
	select MII
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an SMC 91Cxx compatible PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) Ethernet or Fast Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called smc91c92_cs.  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver is for the SMC EtherPower II 9432 PCI Ethernet NIC,
	  which is based on the SMC83c17x (EPIC/100).
	  More specific information and updates are available from
	  <http://www.scyld.com/network/epic100.html>.

	  Say Y here if you want support for SMSC LAN911x and LAN921x families
	  of ethernet controllers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called smsc911x.

config SMSC911X_ARCH_HOOKS
