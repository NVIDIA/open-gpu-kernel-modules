/* The XL710 timesync is very much like Intel's 82599 design when it comes to
 * the fundamental clock design. However, the clock operations are much simpler
 * in the XL710 because the device supports a full 64 bits of nanoseconds.
 * Because the field is so wide, we can forgo the cycle counter and just
 * operate with the nanosecond field directly without fear of overflow.
 *
 * Much like the 82599, the update period is dependent upon the link speed:
 * At 40Gb link or no link, the period is 1.6ns.
 * At 10Gb link, the period is multiplied by 2. (3.2ns)
 * At 1Gb link, the period is multiplied by 20. (32ns)
 * 1588 functionality is not supported at 100Mbps.
