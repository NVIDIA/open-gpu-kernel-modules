config SLIP
	tristate "SLIP (serial line) support"
	depends on TTY
	help
	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
	  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
	  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called slip.

config SLHC
	tristate
	help
	  This option enables Van Jacobsen serial line header compression
	  routines.

if SLIP

config SLIP_COMPRESSED
	bool "CSLIP compressed headers"
	depends on SLIP
	select SLHC
	help
	  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
	  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
	  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
	  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you
	  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure
	  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

config SLIP_SMART
	bool "Keepalive and linefill"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
	  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
	  analogue lines.

config SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
	bool "Six bit SLIP encapsulation"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
	  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.
