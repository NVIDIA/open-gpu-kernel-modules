	depends on LEDS_TRIGGERS
	help
	  Adds support for a set of LED trigger events per-PHY.  Link
	  state change will trigger the events, for consumption by an
	  LED class driver.  There are triggers for each link speed currently
	  supported by the PHY and also a one common "link" trigger as a
	  logical-or of all the link speed ones.
	  All these triggers are named according to the following pattern:
	      <mii bus id>:<phy>:<speed>

	  Where speed is in the form:
		<Speed in megabits>Mbps OR <Speed in gigabits>Gbps OR link
		for any speed known to the PHY.
