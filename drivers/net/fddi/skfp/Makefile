# NOTE:
#   Compiling this driver produces some warnings (and some more are 
#   switched off below), but I did not fix this, because the Hardware
#   Module source (see skfddi.c for details) is used for different
#   drivers, and fixing it for Linux might bring problems on other
#   projects. To keep the source common for all those drivers (and
#   thus simplify fixes to it), please do not clean it up!
