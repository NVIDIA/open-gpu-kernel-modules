	  Xillybus is a generic interface for peripherals designed on
	  programmable logic (FPGA). The driver probes the hardware for
	  its capabilities, and creates device files accordingly.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Set to M if you want Xillybus to use PCI Express for communicating
	  with the FPGA.

	help
	  Set to M if you want Xillybus to find its resources from the
	  Open Firmware Flattened Device Tree. If the target is an embedded
	  system, say M.
