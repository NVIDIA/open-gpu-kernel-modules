/*
 * Design
 *
 * This is a generic 5380 driver.  To use it on a different platform,
 * one simply writes appropriate system specific macros (ie, data
 * transfer - some PC's will use the I/O bus, 68K's must use
 * memory mapped) and drops this file in their 'C' wrapper.
 *
 * As far as command queueing, two queues are maintained for
 * each 5380 in the system - commands that haven't been issued yet,
 * and commands that are currently executing.  This means that an
 * unlimited number of commands may be queued, letting
 * more commands propagate from the higher driver levels giving higher
 * throughput.  Note that both I_T_L and I_T_L_Q nexuses are supported,
 * allowing multiple commands to propagate all the way to a SCSI-II device
 * while a command is already executing.
 *
 *
 * Issues specific to the NCR5380 :
 *
 * When used in a PIO or pseudo-dma mode, the NCR5380 is a braindead
 * piece of hardware that requires you to sit in a loop polling for
 * the REQ signal as long as you are connected.  Some devices are
 * brain dead (ie, many TEXEL CD ROM drives) and won't disconnect
 * while doing long seek operations. [...] These
 * broken devices are the exception rather than the rule and I'd rather
 * spend my time optimizing for the normal case.
 *
 * Architecture :
 *
 * At the heart of the design is a coroutine, NCR5380_main,
 * which is started from a workqueue for each NCR5380 host in the
 * system.  It attempts to establish I_T_L or I_T_L_Q nexuses by
 * removing the commands from the issue queue and calling
 * NCR5380_select() if a nexus is not established.
 *
 * Once a nexus is established, the NCR5380_information_transfer()
 * phase goes through the various phases as instructed by the target.
 * if the target goes into MSG IN and sends a DISCONNECT message,
 * the command structure is placed into the per instance disconnected
 * queue, and NCR5380_main tries to find more work.  If the target is
 * idle for too long, the system will try to sleep.
 *
 * If a command has disconnected, eventually an interrupt will trigger,
 * calling NCR5380_intr()  which will in turn call NCR5380_reselect
 * to reestablish a nexus.  This will run main if necessary.
 *
 * On command termination, the done function will be called as
 * appropriate.
 *
 * SCSI pointers are maintained in the SCp field of SCSI command
 * structures, being initialized after the command is connected
 * in NCR5380_select, and set as appropriate in NCR5380_information_transfer.
 * Note that in violation of the standard, an implicit SAVE POINTERS operation
 * is done, since some BROKEN disks fail to issue an explicit SAVE POINTERS.
 */

/*
 * Using this file :
 * This file a skeleton Linux SCSI driver for the NCR 5380 series
 * of chips.  To use it, you write an architecture specific functions
 * and macros and include this file in your driver.
 *
 * These macros MUST be defined :
 *
 * NCR5380_read(register)  - read from the specified register
 *
 * NCR5380_write(register, value) - write to the specific register
 *
 * NCR5380_implementation_fields  - additional fields needed for this
 * specific implementation of the NCR5380
 *
 * Either real DMA *or* pseudo DMA may be implemented
 *
 * NCR5380_dma_xfer_len   - determine size of DMA/PDMA transfer
 * NCR5380_dma_send_setup - execute DMA/PDMA from memory to 5380
 * NCR5380_dma_recv_setup - execute DMA/PDMA from 5380 to memory
 * NCR5380_dma_residual   - residual byte count
 *
 * The generic driver is initialized by calling NCR5380_init(instance),
 * after setting the appropriate host specific fields and ID.

 * NCR5380_intr - generic NCR5380 irq handler

 * @dev_id: device info
 *
 * Handle interrupts, reestablishing I_T_L or I_T_L_Q nexuses
 * from the disconnected queue, and restarting NCR5380_main()
 * as required.
 *
 * The chip can assert IRQ in any of six different conditions. The IRQ flag
 * is then cleared by reading the Reset Parity/Interrupt Register (RPIR).
 * Three of these six conditions are latched in the Bus and Status Register:
 * - End of DMA (cleared by ending DMA Mode)
 * - Parity error (cleared by reading RPIR)
 * - Loss of BSY (cleared by reading RPIR)
 * Two conditions have flag bits that are not latched:
 * - Bus phase mismatch (non-maskable in DMA Mode, cleared by ending DMA Mode)
 * - Bus reset (non-maskable)
 * The remaining condition has no flag bit at all:
 * - Selection/reselection
 *
 * Hence, establishing the cause(s) of any interrupt is partly guesswork.
 * In "The DP8490 and DP5380 Comparison Guide", National Semiconductor
 * claimed that "the design of the [DP8490] interrupt logic ensures
 * interrupts will not be lost (they can be on the DP5380)."
 * The L5380/53C80 datasheet from LOGIC Devices has more details.
 *
 * Checking for bus reset by reading RST is futile because of interrupt
 * latency, but a bus reset will reset chip logic. Checking for parity error
 * is unnecessary because that interrupt is never enabled. A Loss of BSY
 * condition will clear DMA Mode. We can tell when this occurs because the
 * the Busy Monitor interrupt is enabled together with DMA Mode.

 * A note regarding the DMA errata workarounds for early NMOS silicon.
 *
 * For DMA sends, we want to wait until the last byte has been
 * transferred out over the bus before we turn off DMA mode.  Alas, there
 * seems to be no terribly good way of doing this on a 5380 under all
 * conditions.  For non-scatter-gather operations, we can wait until REQ
 * and ACK both go false, or until a phase mismatch occurs.  Gather-sends
 * are nastier, since the device will be expecting more data than we
 * are prepared to send it, and REQ will remain asserted.  On a 53C8[01] we
 * could test Last Byte Sent to assure transfer (I imagine this is precisely
 * why this signal was added to the newer chips) but on the older 538[01]
 * this signal does not exist.  The workaround for this lack is a watchdog;
 * we bail out of the wait-loop after a modest amount of wait-time if
 * the usual exit conditions are not met.  Not a terribly clean or
 * correct solution :-%
 *
 * DMA receive is equally tricky due to a nasty characteristic of the NCR5380.
 * If the chip is in DMA receive mode, it will respond to a target's
 * REQ by latching the SCSI data into the INPUT DATA register and asserting
 * ACK, even if it has _already_ been notified by the DMA controller that
 * the current DMA transfer has completed!  If the NCR5380 is then taken
 * out of DMA mode, this already-acknowledged byte is lost. This is
 * not a problem for "one DMA transfer per READ command", because
 * the situation will never arise... either all of the data is DMA'ed
 * properly, or the target switches to MESSAGE IN phase to signal a
 * disconnection (either operation bringing the DMA to a clean halt).
 * However, in order to handle scatter-receive, we must work around the
 * problem.  The chosen fix is to DMA fewer bytes, then check for the
 * condition before taking the NCR5380 out of DMA mode.  One or two extra
 * bytes are transferred via PIO as necessary to fill out the original
 * request.

 * the target an abort message. This may not succeed in causing a target
 * to abort the command. Nonetheless, the low-level driver must forget about
 * the command because the mid-layer reclaims it and it may be re-issued.
 *
 * The normal path taken by a command is as follows. For EH we trace this
 * same path to locate and abort the command.
 *
 * unissued -> selecting -> [unissued -> selecting ->]... connected ->
 * [disconnected -> connected ->]...
 * [autosense -> connected ->] done
 *
 * If cmd was not found at all then presumably it has already been completed,
 * in which case return SUCCESS to try to avoid further EH measures.
 *
 * If the command has not completed yet, we must not fail to find it.
 * We have no option but to forget the aborted command (even if it still
 * lacks sense data). The mid-layer may re-issue a command that is in error
 * recovery (see scsi_send_eh_cmnd), but the logic and data structures in
 * this driver are such that a command can appear on one queue only.
 *
 * The lock protects driver data structures, but EH handlers also use it
 * to serialize their own execution and prevent their own re-entry.
