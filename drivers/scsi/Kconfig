	  the name of your SCSI host adapter (the card inside your computer
	  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol, also called SCSI controller),

	  You also need to say Y here if you have a device which speaks

	  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
	  about anything having "SCSI" in its name other than hard disks,
	  CD-ROMs or tapes, say Y here. These won't be supported by the kernel
	  directly, so you need some additional software which knows how to
	  talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

	  For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.sane-project.org/>). For CD
	  writer software look at Cdrtools
	  (<http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/>)
	  and for burning a "disk at once": CDRDAO
	  (<http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>). Cdparanoia is a high
	  quality digital reader of audio CDs (<http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/>).
	  For other devices, it's possible that you'll have to write the
	  driver software yourself. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-generic.rst> for more information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read

	  changers are listed as "Type: Medium Changer" in /proc/scsi/scsi.
	  If you have such hardware and want to use it with linux, say Y
	  here.  Check <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-changer.rst> for details.
	
	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),

config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.

	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo <bitmask> > /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level

	  where <bitmask> is a four byte value representing the logging type
	  and logging level for each type of logging selected.

	  There are a number of logging types and you can find them in the
	  source at <file:drivers/scsi/scsi_logging.h>. The logging levels
	  are also described in that file and they determine the verbosity of
	  the logging for each logging type.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

config SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC

	  The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the

	  You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
	  or async on the kernel's command line.

	  Note that this setting also affects whether resuming from
	  system suspend will be performed asynchronously.

	 The iSCSI Driver provides a host with the ability to access storage
	 through an IP network. The driver uses the iSCSI protocol to transport
	 SCSI requests and responses over a TCP/IP network between the host
	 (the "initiator") and "targets".  Architecturally, the iSCSI driver
	 combines with the host's TCP/IP stack, network drivers, and Network
	 Interface Card (NIC) to provide the same functions as a SCSI or a
	 Fibre Channel (FC) adapter driver with a Host Bus Adapter (HBA).

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON
	default "8"
	help
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON
	default "32"
	help
	  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
	  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
	  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON
	default "20"
	help
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_NO_DISCONNECT

	  device of yours to not support properly the target-disconnect
	  feature. In that case, you would say Y here. In general however, to
	  not allow targets to disconnect is not reasonable if there is more
	  than 1 device on a SCSI bus. The normal answer therefore is N.
