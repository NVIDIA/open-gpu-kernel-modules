/*
 * Some vendor's UFS device sends back to back NACs for the DL data frames
 * causing the host controller to raise the DFES error status. Sometimes
 * such UFS devices send back to back NAC without waiting for new
 * retransmitted DL frame from the host and in such cases it might be possible
 * the Host UniPro goes into bad state without raising the DFES error
 * interrupt. If this happens then all the pending commands would timeout
 * only after respective SW command (which is generally too large).
 *
 * We can workaround such device behaviour like this:
 * - As soon as SW sees the DL NAC error, it should schedule the error handler
 * - Error handler would sleep for 50ms to see if there are any fatal errors
 *   raised by UFS controller.
 *    - If there are fatal errors then SW does normal error recovery.
 *    - If there are no fatal errors then SW sends the NOP command to device
 *      to check if link is alive.
 *        - If NOP command times out, SW does normal error recovery
 *        - If NOP command succeed, skip the error handling.
 *
 * If DL NAC error is seen multiple times with some vendor's UFS devices then
 * enable this quirk to initiate quick error recovery and also silence related
 * error logs to reduce spamming of kernel logs.
