config SCSI_MPT3SAS
	tristate "LSI MPT Fusion SAS 3.0 & SAS 2.0 Device Driver"
	depends on PCI && SCSI
	select SCSI_SAS_ATTRS
	select RAID_ATTRS
	select IRQ_POLL
	help
	This driver supports PCI-Express SAS 12Gb/s Host Adapters.

config SCSI_MPT2SAS_MAX_SGE
	int "LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 Max number of SG Entries (16 - 256)"
	depends on PCI && SCSI && SCSI_MPT3SAS
	default "128"
	range 16 256
	help
	This option allows you to specify the maximum number of scatter-
	gather entries per I/O. The driver default is 128, which matches
	MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS in most kernels.  However in SuSE kernels this
	can be 256. However, it may decreased down to 16.  Decreasing this
	parameter will reduce memory requirements on a per controller instance.

	Dummy config option for backwards compatibility: configure the MPT3SAS
	driver instead.
