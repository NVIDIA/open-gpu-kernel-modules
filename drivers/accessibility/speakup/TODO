Speakup is a kernel based screen review package for the linux operating
system.  It allows blind users to interact with applications on the
linux console by means of synthetic speech.

Currently, speakup has one issue we know of.

It seems to only happen on SMP systems. It seems that text in the output buffer
gets garbled because a lock is not set. This bug happens regularly, but no one
has been able to find a situation which produces it consistently.

Patches, suggestions, corrections, etc, are definitely welcome.
