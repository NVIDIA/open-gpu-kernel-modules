	bool "Accessibility support"
	help
	  Accessibility handles all special kinds of hardware devices or
	  software adapters which help people with disabilities (e.g.
	  blindness) to use computers.

	  That includes braille devices, speech synthesis, keyboard
	  remapping, etc.

	  Say Y here to get to see options for accessibility.
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

	  If unsure, say N.

if ACCESSIBILITY

	bool "Console on braille device"
	depends on VT
	depends on SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  Enables console output on a braille device connected to a 8250
	  serial port. For now only the VisioBraille device is supported.

	  To actually enable it, you need to pass option
	  console=brl,ttyS0
	  to the kernel. Options are the same as for serial console.

	  If unsure, say N.
