	  This enables support for the Firmware Memory controller (FMC)
	  in the Aspeed AST2500/AST2400 SoCs when attached to SPI NOR chips,
	  and support for the SPI flash memory controller (SPI) for
	  the host firmware. The implementation only supports SPI NOR.

	  Enable support for the NXP LPC SPI Flash Interface controller.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

	  This enables PCI support for the Intel PCH/PCU SPI controller in

	  and is used to hold BIOS and other persistent settings. Using
	  this driver it is possible to upgrade BIOS directly from Linux.

	  Say N here unless you know what you are doing. Overwriting the

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel-spi-pci.
