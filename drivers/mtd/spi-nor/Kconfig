	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

config MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE
	bool "Disable SWP on any flashes (legacy behavior)"
	help
	  This option disables the software write protection on any SPI
	  flashes at boot-up.

	  Depending on the flash chip this either clears the block protection
	  bits or does a "Global Unprotect" command.

	  Don't use this if you intent to use the software write protection
	  of your SPI flash. This is only to keep backwards compatibility.

config MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_DISABLE_ON_VOLATILE
	bool "Disable SWP on flashes w/ volatile protection bits"
	help
	  Some SPI flashes have volatile block protection bits, ie. after a
	  power-up or a reset the flash is software write protected by
	  default.

	  This option disables the software write protection for these kind
	  of flashes while keeping it enabled for any other SPI flashes
	  which have non-volatile write protection bits.

	  If the software write protection will be disabled depending on
	  the flash either the block protection bits are cleared or a
	  "Global Unprotect" command is issued.

	  If you are unsure, select this option.

config MTD_SPI_NOR_SWP_KEEP
	bool "Keep software write protection as is"
	help
	  If you select this option the software write protection of any
	  SPI flashes will not be changed. If your flash is software write
	  protected or will be automatically software write protected after
	  power-up you have to manually unlock it before you are able to
	  write to it.
