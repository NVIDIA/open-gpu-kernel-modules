	  This enables support for software Hamming error
	  correction. This correction can correct up to 1 bit error
	  per chunk and detect up to 2 bit errors. While it used to be
	  widely used with old parts, newer NAND chips usually require
	  more strength correction and in this case BCH or RS will be
	  preferred.

	  Software ECC according to the Smart Media Specification.
	  The original Linux implementation had byte 0 and 1 swapped.

	help
	  This enables support for software BCH error correction. Binary BCH
	  codes are more powerful and cpu intensive than traditional Hamming
	  ECC codes. They are used with NAND devices requiring more than 1 bit
	  of error correction.
