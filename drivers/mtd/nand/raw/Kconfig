	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium

	  device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL
	  data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems'
	  DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for
	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and
	  Linux will not write BBT data into this area.
	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks
	  are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which
	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.
	  Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module
	  load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module
	  parameter "inftl_bbt_write=1".
