 * @UBI_VTBL_SKIP_CRC_CHECK_FLG: skip the CRC check done on a static volume at
 *				 open time. Should only be set on volumes that
 *				 are used by upper layers doing this kind of
 *				 check. Main use-case for this flag is
 *				 boot-time reduction
 *
 * %UBI_VTBL_AUTORESIZE_FLG flag can be set only for one volume in the volume
 * table. UBI automatically re-sizes the volume which has this flag and makes
 * the volume to be of largest possible size. This means that if after the
 * initialization UBI finds out that there are available physical eraseblocks
 * present on the device, it automatically appends all of them to the volume
 * (the physical eraseblocks reserved for bad eraseblocks handling and other
 * reserved physical eraseblocks are not taken). So, if there is a volume with
 * the %UBI_VTBL_AUTORESIZE_FLG flag set, the amount of available logical
 * eraseblocks will be zero after UBI is loaded, because all of them will be
 * reserved for this volume. Note, the %UBI_VTBL_AUTORESIZE_FLG bit is cleared
 * after the volume had been initialized.
 *
 * The auto-resize feature is useful for device production purposes. For
 * example, different NAND flash chips may have different amount of initial bad
 * eraseblocks, depending of particular chip instance. Manufacturers of NAND
 * chips usually guarantee that the amount of initial bad eraseblocks does not
 * exceed certain percent, e.g. 2%. When one creates an UBI image which will be
 * flashed to the end devices in production, he does not know the exact amount
 * of good physical eraseblocks the NAND chip on the device will have, but this
 * number is required to calculate the volume sized and put them to the volume
 * table of the UBI image. In this case, one of the volumes (e.g., the one
 * which will store the root file system) is marked as "auto-resizable", and
 * UBI will adjust its size on the first boot if needed.
 *
 * Note, first UBI reserves some amount of physical eraseblocks for bad
 * eraseblock handling, and then re-sizes the volume, not vice-versa. This
 * means that the pool of reserved physical eraseblocks will always be present.

 *
 * The @image_seq field is used to validate a UBI image that has been prepared

 * @data_crc: CRC checksum of the data stored in this logical eraseblock
 * @padding2: reserved for future, zeroes
 * @sqnum: sequence number
 * @padding3: reserved for future, zeroes
 * @hdr_crc: volume identifier header CRC checksum
 *
 * The @sqnum is the value of the global sequence counter at the time when this
 * VID header was created. The global sequence counter is incremented each time
 * UBI writes a new VID header to the flash, i.e. when it maps a logical
 * eraseblock to a new physical eraseblock. The global sequence counter is an
 * unsigned 64-bit integer and we assume it never overflows. The @sqnum
 * (sequence number) is used to distinguish between older and newer versions of
 * logical eraseblocks.
 *
 * There are 2 situations when there may be more than one physical eraseblock
 * corresponding to the same logical eraseblock, i.e., having the same @vol_id
 * and @lnum values in the volume identifier header. Suppose we have a logical
 * eraseblock L and it is mapped to the physical eraseblock P.
 *
 * 1. Because UBI may erase physical eraseblocks asynchronously, the following
 * situation is possible: L is asynchronously erased, so P is scheduled for
 * erasure, then L is written to,i.e. mapped to another physical eraseblock P1,
 * so P1 is written to, then an unclean reboot happens. Result - there are 2
 * physical eraseblocks P and P1 corresponding to the same logical eraseblock
 * L. But P1 has greater sequence number, so UBI picks P1 when it attaches the
 * flash.
 *
 * 2. From time to time UBI moves logical eraseblocks to other physical
 * eraseblocks for wear-leveling reasons. If, for example, UBI moves L from P
 * to P1, and an unclean reboot happens before P is physically erased, there
 * are two physical eraseblocks P and P1 corresponding to L and UBI has to
 * select one of them when the flash is attached. The @sqnum field says which
 * PEB is the original (obviously P will have lower @sqnum) and the copy. But
 * it is not enough to select the physical eraseblock with the higher sequence
 * number, because the unclean reboot could have happen in the middle of the
 * copying process, so the data in P is corrupted. It is also not enough to
 * just select the physical eraseblock with lower sequence number, because the
 * data there may be old (consider a case if more data was added to P1 after
 * the copying). Moreover, the unclean reboot may happen when the erasure of P
 * was just started, so it result in unstable P, which is "mostly" OK, but
 * still has unstable bits.
 *
 * UBI uses the @copy_flag field to indicate that this logical eraseblock is a
 * copy. UBI also calculates data CRC when the data is moved and stores it at
 * the @data_crc field of the copy (P1). So when UBI needs to pick one physical
 * eraseblock of two (P or P1), the @copy_flag of the newer one (P1) is
 * examined. If it is cleared, the situation is simple and the newer one is
 * picked. If it is set, the data CRC of the copy (P1) is examined. If the CRC
 * checksum is correct, this physical eraseblock is selected (P1). Otherwise
 * the older one (P) is selected.
 *
 * There are 2 sorts of volumes in UBI: user volumes and internal volumes.
 * Internal volumes are not seen from outside and are used for various internal
 * UBI purposes. In this implementation there is only one internal volume - the
 * layout volume. Internal volumes are the main mechanism of UBI extensions.
 * For example, in future one may introduce a journal internal volume. Internal
 * volumes have their own reserved range of IDs.
 *
 * The @compat field is only used for internal volumes and contains the "degree
 * of their compatibility". It is always zero for user volumes. This field
 * provides a mechanism to introduce UBI extensions and to be still compatible
 * with older UBI binaries. For example, if someone introduced a journal in
 * future, he would probably use %UBI_COMPAT_DELETE compatibility for the
 * journal volume.  And in this case, older UBI binaries, which know nothing
 * about the journal volume, would just delete this volume and work perfectly
 * fine. This is similar to what Ext2fs does when it is fed by an Ext3fs image
 * - it just ignores the Ext3fs journal.
 *
 * The @data_crc field contains the CRC checksum of the contents of the logical
 * eraseblock if this is a static volume. In case of dynamic volumes, it does
 * not contain the CRC checksum as a rule. The only exception is when the
 * data of the physical eraseblock was moved by the wear-leveling sub-system,
 * then the wear-leveling sub-system calculates the data CRC and stores it in
 * the @data_crc field. And of course, the @copy_flag is %in this case.
 *
 * The @data_size field is used only for static volumes because UBI has to know
 * how many bytes of data are stored in this eraseblock. For dynamic volumes,
 * this field usually contains zero. The only exception is when the data of the
 * physical eraseblock was moved to another physical eraseblock for
 * wear-leveling reasons. In this case, UBI calculates CRC checksum of the
 * contents and uses both @data_crc and @data_size fields. In this case, the
 * @data_size field contains data size.
 *
 * The @used_ebs field is used only for static volumes and indicates how many
 * eraseblocks the data of the volume takes. For dynamic volumes this field is
 * not used and always contains zero.
 *
 * The @data_pad is calculated when volumes are created using the alignment
 * parameter. So, effectively, the @data_pad field reduces the size of logical
 * eraseblocks of this volume. This is very handy when one uses block-oriented
 * software (say, cramfs) on top of the UBI volume.
