 *  While this file is called 'ioctl' is purpose goes a little beyond
 *  that.  This file defines the types and contants used to implement
 *  the p80211 request/confirm/indicate interfaces on Linux.  The
 *  request/confirm interface is, in fact, normally implemented as an
 *  ioctl.  The indicate interface on the other hand, is implemented
 *  using the Linux 'netlink' interface.
 *
 *  The reason I say that request/confirm is 'normally' implemented
 *  via ioctl is that we're reserving the right to be able to send
 *  request commands via the netlink interface.  This will be necessary
 *  if we ever need to send request messages when there aren't any
 *  wlan network devices present (i.e. sending a message that only p80211
 *  cares about.
