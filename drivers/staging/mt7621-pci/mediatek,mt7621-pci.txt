MediaTek MT7621 PCIe controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt7621-pci"
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- reg: Base addresses and lengths of the PCIe subsys and root ports.
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller.
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
- pinctrl-names : The pin control state names.
- pinctrl-0: The "default" pinctrl state.
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- ranges: Ranges for the PCI memory and I/O regions.
- #interrupt-cells: Must be 1
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties.
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- status: either "disabled" or "okay".
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must be "pcie0", "pcie1", "pcieN"... based on the number of
  root ports.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must be "pcie0", "pcie1", "pcieN"... based on the number of
  root ports.
- reset-gpios: GPIO specs for the reset pins.

In addition, the device tree node must have sub-nodes describing each PCIe port
interface, having the following mandatory properties:

Required properties:
- reg: Only the first four bytes are used to refer to the correct bus number
      and device number.
- #address-cells: Must be 3
- #size-cells: Must be 2
- ranges: Sub-ranges distributed from the PCIe controller node. An empty
  property is sufficient.
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this port.
