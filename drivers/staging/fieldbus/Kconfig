	  Support for Fieldbus Device Adapters.

	  Fieldbus device (client) adapters allow data exchange with a PLC aka.
	  "Fieldbus Controller" over a fieldbus (Profinet, FLNet, etc.)

	  They are typically used when a Linux device wants to expose itself
	  as an actuator, motor, console light, switch, etc. over the fieldbus.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to Fieldbus
	  Devices from both the Linux Kernel and the userspace.

	  If unsure, say no.
