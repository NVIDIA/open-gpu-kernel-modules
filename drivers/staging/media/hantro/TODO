* Support for VP8, VP9 and H264 is planned for this driver.

  Given the V4L controls for those CODECs will be part of
  the uABI, it will be required to have the driver in staging.

  For this reason, we are keeping this driver in staging for now.

* Add support for the S_SELECTION API.
  See the comment for VEPU_REG_ENC_OVER_FILL_STRM_OFFSET.

* Instead of having a DMA bounce buffer, it could be possible to use a
  normal buffer and memmove() the payload to make space for the header.
  This might need to use extra JPEG markers for padding reasons.
