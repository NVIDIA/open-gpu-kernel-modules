This driver is in staging until the V4L2 documentation about stateful video
decoders is finalized, as well as the corresponding compliance tests.

It is at the moment not guaranteed to work properly with a userspace
stack that follows the latest version of the specification, especially
with compression standards like MPEG1/2 where the driver does not support
dynamic resolution switching, including the first one used to determine coded
resolution.
