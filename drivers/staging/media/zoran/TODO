How to test the zoran driver:
- RAW capture
	mplayer tv:///dev/video0 -tv driver=v4l2

- MJPEG capture (compression)
	mplayer tv:///dev/video0 -tv driver=v4l2:outfmt=mjpeg
	TODO: need two test for both Dcim path

- MJPEG play (decompression)
	ffmpeg -i test.avi -vcodec mjpeg -an -f v4l2 /dev/video0
	Note: only recent ffmpeg has the ability of sending non-raw video via v4l2

	The original way of sending video was via mplayer vo_zr/vo_zr2, but it does not compile
	anymore and is a dead end (usage of some old private ffmpeg structures).

TODO
- fix the v4l compliance "TRY_FMT cannot handle an invalid pixelformat"
- Filter JPEG data to made output work
