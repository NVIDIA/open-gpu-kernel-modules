	  Add support for HiSilicon Hi6421v600 SPMI PMIC. Hi6421 includes
	  multi-functions, such as regulators, RTC, codec, Coulomb counter,
	  etc.

	  This driver includes core APIs _only_. You have to select
	  individual components like voltage regulators under corresponding
	  menus in order to enable them.
	  We communicate with the Hi6421v600 via a SPMI bus.
