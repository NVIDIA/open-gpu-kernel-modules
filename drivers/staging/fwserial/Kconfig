	help
	  This enables TTY over IEEE 1394, providing high-speed serial
	  connectivity to cabled peers. This driver implements a
	  ad-hoc transport protocol and is currently limited to
	  Linux-to-Linux communication.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  the module will
	  be called firewire-serial.

	  Set this to the maximum number of serial ports you want the
	  firewire-serial driver to support.

	  Set this to the maximum number of serial ports each firewire
	  adapter supports. The actual number of serial ports registered
	  is set with the module parameter "ttys".
