TODOs prior to this driver moving out of staging
------------------------------------------------
1. Implement retries for RCODE_BUSY, RCODE_NO_ACK and RCODE_SEND_ERROR
   - I/O is handled asynchronously which presents some issues when error
     conditions occur.
2. Implement _robust_ console on top of this. The existing prototype console
   driver is not ready for the big leagues yet.
3. Expose means of controlling attach/detach of peers via sysfs. Include
   GUID-to-port matching/whitelist/blacklist.

-- Issues with firewire stack --
1. This driver uses the same unregistered vendor id that the firewire core does
     (0xd00d1e). Perhaps this could be exposed as a define in
     firewire.h?
