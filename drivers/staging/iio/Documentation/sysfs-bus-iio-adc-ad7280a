Description:
		Writing 1 enables the cell balance output switch corresponding
		to input Y. Writing 0 disables it. If the inY-inZ_balance_timer
		is set to a none zero value, the corresponding switch will
		enable for the programmed amount of time, before it
		automatically disables.

Description:
		The inY-inZ_balance_timer file allows the user to program
		individual times for each cell balance output. The AD7280A
		allows the user to set the timer to a value from 0 minutes to
		36.9 minutes. The resolution of the timer is 71.5 sec.
		The value written is the on-time in milliseconds. When the
		timer value is set 0, the timer is disabled. The cell balance
		outputs are controlled only by inY-inZ_balance_switch_en.
