What:		parahotplug/deviceenabled
Date:		7/18/2014
KernelVersion: 	TBD
Contact:	sparmaintainer@unisys.com
Description:	This entry is used by a Unisys support script installed on the
		guest, and triggered by a udev event. The support script is
		responsible for enabling and disabling SR-IOV devices when the
		PF device is being recovered in another guest.

		Some SR-IOV devices have problems when the PF is reset without
		first disabling all VFs attached to that PF. s-Par handles this
		situation by sending a message to guests using these VFs, and
		the script will disable the device. When the PF is recovered,
		another message is sent to the guests to re-enable the VFs.

		The parahotplug/deviceenabled interface is used to acknowledge
		the recovery message.
