TODO:
	- enhance visornic to use channel_interrupt() hook instead of a
	  kernel thread
	- enhance visorhba to use channel_interrupt() hook instead of a
	  kernel thread
	- teach visorbus to handle virtual interrupts triggered by s-Par
	  back-end, and call function driver's channel_interrupt() function
	  when they occur
	- enhance debugfs interfaces (e.g., per device, etc.)
	- upgrade/remove deprecated workqueue operations
	- move individual drivers into proper driver subsystems
