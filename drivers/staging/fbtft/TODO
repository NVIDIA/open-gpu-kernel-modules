* convert all uses of the old GPIO API from <linux/gpio.h> to the
  GPIO descriptor API in <linux/gpio/consumer.h> and look up GPIO
  lines from device tree, ACPI or board files, board files should
  use <linux/gpio/machine.h>

* convert all these over to drm_simple_display_pipe and submit for inclusion
  into the DRM subsystem under drivers/gpu/drm - fbdev doesn't take any new
  drivers anymore.
