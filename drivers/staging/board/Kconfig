	  Staging board base is to support continuous upstream
	  in-tree development and integration of platform devices.

	  Helps developers integrate devices as platform devices for
	  device drivers that only provide platform device bindings.
	  This in turn allows for incremental development of both
	  hardware feature support and DT binding work in parallel.
