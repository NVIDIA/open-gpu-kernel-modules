* add clock framework support (platform device with CCF needs special care)
* break out board-specific VBUS GPIO to work with multiplatform
* convert VBUS GPIO to use GPIO descriptors from <linux/gpio/consumer.h>
  and stop using the old GPIO API
* DT bindings
* move driver into drivers/usb/gadget/
