TODO:
	- complete rewrite:
	  1. The underlying fbdev drivers need to be converted into drm kernel
	     modesetting drivers.
	  2. The dcon low-power display mode can then be integrated using the
	     drm damage tracking and self-refresh helpers.
	  This bolted-on self-refresh support that digs around in fbdev
	  internals, but isn't properly integrated, is not the correct solution.
	- see if vx855 gpio API can be made similar enough to cs5535 so we can
	  share more code

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and
