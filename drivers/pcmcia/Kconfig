	help
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: 16 bit PCMCIA and 32 bit
	  CardBus cards.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pcmcia_core.

config PCMCIA
	tristate "16-bit PCMCIA support"
	select CRC32
	default y
	help
	   This option enables support for 16-bit PCMCIA cards. Most older
	   PC-cards are such 16-bit PCMCIA cards, so unless you know you're
	   only using 32-bit CardBus cards, say Y or M here.

	   To use 16-bit PCMCIA cards, you will need supporting software in
	   most cases. (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for
	   location and details).

	   To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	   module will be called pcmcia.

	   If unsure, say Y.

config PCMCIA_LOAD_CIS
	bool "Load CIS updates from userspace"
	depends on PCMCIA
	select FW_LOADER
	default y
	help
	  Some PCMCIA cards require an updated Card Information Structure (CIS)
	  to be loaded from userspace to work correctly. If you say Y here,
	  and your userspace is arranged correctly, this will be loaded
	  automatically using the in-kernel firmware loader and the hotplug
	  subsystem, instead of relying on cardmgr from pcmcia-cs to do so.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CARDBUS
	bool "32-bit CardBus support"
	depends on PCI
	default y
	help
	  CardBus is a bus mastering architecture for PC-cards, which allows
	  for 32 bit PC-cards (the original PCMCIA standard specifies only
	  a 16 bit wide bus). Many newer PC-cards are actually CardBus cards.

	  To use 32 bit PC-cards, you also need a CardBus compatible host
	  bridge. Virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges do this, and most of
	  them are "yenta-compatible", so say Y or M there, too.

	  If unsure, say Y.
