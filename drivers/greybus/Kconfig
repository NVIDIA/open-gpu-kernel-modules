	  This option enables the Greybus driver core.  Greybus is a
	  hardware protocol that was designed to provide Unipro with a
	  sane application layer.  It was originally designed for the
	  ARA project, a module phone system, but has shown up in other
	  phones, and can be tunneled over other busses in order to
	  control hardware devices.

	  Say Y here to enable support for these types of drivers.
