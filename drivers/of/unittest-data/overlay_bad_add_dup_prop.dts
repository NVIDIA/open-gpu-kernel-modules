/*
 * &electric_1/motor-1/electric and &spin_ctrl_1/electric are the same node:
 *   /testcase-data-2/substation@100/motor-1/electric
 *
 * Thus the property "rpm_avail" in each fragment will
 * result in an attempt to update the same property twice.
 * This will result in an error and the overlay apply
 * will fail.
 *
 * The previous version of this test did not include the extra
 * level of node 'electric'.  That resulted in the 'rpm_avail'
 * property being located in the pre-existing node 'motor-1'.
 * Modifying a property results in a WARNING that a memory leak
 * will occur if the overlay is removed.  Since the overlay apply
 * fails, the memory leak does actually occur, and kmemleak will
 * further report the memory leak if CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK is
 * enabled.  Adding the overlay node 'electric' avoids the
 * memory leak and thus people who use kmemleak will not
 * have to debug this non-problem again.
