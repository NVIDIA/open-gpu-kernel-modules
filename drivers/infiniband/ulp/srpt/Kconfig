	  Support for the SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) Target driver. The
	  SRP protocol is a protocol that allows an initiator to access
	  a block storage device on another host (target) over a network
	  that supports the RDMA protocol. Currently the RDMA protocol is
	  supported by InfiniBand and by iWarp network hardware. More
	  information about the SRP protocol can be found on the website
	  of the INCITS T10 technical committee (http://www.t10.org/).
