 * linux/drivers/video/skeletonfb.c -- Skeleton for a frame buffer device
 *
 *  Modified to new api Jan 2001 by James Simmons (jsimmons@transvirtual.com)
 *
 *  Created 28 Dec 1997 by Geert Uytterhoeven
 *
 *
 *  I have started rewriting this driver as a example of the upcoming new API
 *  The primary goal is to remove the console code from fbdev and place it
 *  into fbcon.c. This reduces the code and makes writing a new fbdev driver
 *  easy since the author doesn't need to worry about console internals. It
 *  also allows the ability to run fbdev without a console/tty system on top 
 *  of it. 
 *
 *  First the roles of struct fb_info and struct display have changed. Struct
 *  display will go away. The way the new framebuffer console code will
 *  work is that it will act to translate data about the tty/console in 
 *  struct vc_data to data in a device independent way in struct fb_info. Then
 *  various functions in struct fb_ops will be called to store the device 
 *  dependent state in the par field in struct fb_info and to change the 
 *  hardware to that state. This allows a very clean separation of the fbdev
 *  layer from the console layer. It also allows one to use fbdev on its own
 *  which is a bounus for embedded devices. The reason this approach works is  
 *  for each framebuffer device when used as a tty/console device is allocated
 *  a set of virtual terminals to it. Only one virtual terminal can be active 
 *  per framebuffer device. We already have all the data we need in struct 
 *  vc_data so why store a bunch of colormaps and other fbdev specific data
 *  per virtual terminal. 
 *
 *  As you can see doing this makes the con parameter pretty much useless
 *  for struct fb_ops functions, as it should be. Also having struct  
 *  fb_var_screeninfo and other data in fb_info pretty much eliminates the 
 *  need for get_fix and get_var. Once all drivers use the fix, var, and cmap
 *  fbcon can be written around these fields. This will also eliminate the
 *  need to regenerate struct fb_var_screeninfo, struct fb_fix_screeninfo
 *  struct fb_cmap every time get_var, get_fix, get_cmap functions are called
 *  as many drivers do now.

     * 	Modern graphical hardware not only supports pipelines but some

     *  represented by a separate framebuffer device thus a separate 
     *  struct fb_info. Now the struct xxx_par represents the graphics
     *  hardware state thus only one exist per card. In this case the 
     *  struct xxx_par for each graphics card would be shared between 
     *  every struct fb_info that represents a framebuffer on that card. 
     *  This allows when one display changes it video resolution (info->var)
