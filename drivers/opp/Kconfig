	  SOCs have a standard set of tuples consisting of frequency and
	  voltage pairs that the device will support per voltage domain. This
	  is called Operating Performance Point or OPP. The actual definitions
	  of OPP varies over silicon within the same family of devices.

	  OPP layer organizes the data internally using device pointers
	  representing individual voltage domains and provides SOC
	  implementations a ready to use framework to manage OPPs.
