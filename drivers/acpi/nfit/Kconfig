	  Infrastructure to probe ACPI 6 compliant platforms for
	  NVDIMMs (NFIT) and register a libnvdimm device tree.  In
	  addition to storage devices this also enables libnvdimm to pass
	  ACPI._DSM messages for platform/dimm configuration.

	  the module will be called nfit.

	  Some NVDIMM devices and controllers support encryption and
	  other security features. The payloads for the commands that
	  enable those features may contain sensitive clear-text
	  security material. Disable debug of those command payloads
	  by default. If you are a kernel developer actively working
	  on NVDIMM security enabling say Y, otherwise say N.
