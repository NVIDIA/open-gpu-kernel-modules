	depends on MFD_TPS68470
	help
	  This config adds ACPI operation region support for TI TPS68470 PMIC.
	  TPS68470 device is an advanced power management unit that powers
	  a Compact Camera Module (CCM), generates clocks for image sensors,
	  drives a dual LED for flash and incorporates two LED drivers for
	  general purpose indicators.
	  This driver enables ACPI operation region support control voltage
	  regulators and clocks.

	  This option is a bool as it provides an ACPI operation
	  region, which must be available before any of the devices
	  using this, are probed.
