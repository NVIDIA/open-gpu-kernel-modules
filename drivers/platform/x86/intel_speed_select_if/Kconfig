	  This config enables the Intel(R) Speed Select Technology interface
	  drivers. The Intel(R) speed select technology features are non
	  architectural and only supported on specific Xeon(R) servers.
	  These drivers provide interface to directly communicate with hardware
	  via MMIO and Mail boxes to enumerate and control all the speed select
	  features.

	  Enable this config, if there is a need to enable and control the
	  Intel(R) Speed Select Technology features from the user space.
