/*
 * To simplify reasoning about the code below, we define a few concepts. The
 * system below is similar to a state-machine for packets, however, there are
 * too many states to explicitly write them down. To (somewhat) manage the
 * states and packets we rely on flags, reference counting, and some simple
 * concepts. State transitions are triggered by actions.
 *
 * >> Actions <<
 *
 * - submit
 * - transmission start (process next item in queue)
 * - transmission finished (guaranteed to never be parallel to transmission
 *   start)
 * - ACK received
 * - NAK received (this is equivalent to issuing re-submit for all pending
 *   packets)
 * - timeout (this is equivalent to re-issuing a submit or canceling)
 * - cancel (non-pending and pending)
 *
 * >> Data Structures, Packet Ownership, General Overview <<
 *
 * The code below employs two main data structures: The packet queue,
 * containing all packets scheduled for transmission, and the set of pending
 * packets, containing all packets awaiting an ACK.
 *
 * Shared ownership of a packet is controlled via reference counting. Inside
 * the transport system are a total of five packet owners:
 *
 * - the packet queue,
 * - the pending set,
 * - the transmitter thread,
 * - the receiver thread (via ACKing), and
 * - the timeout work item.
 *
 * Normal operation is as follows: The initial reference of the packet is
 * obtained by submitting the packet and queuing it. The receiver thread takes
 * packets from the queue. By doing this, it does not increment the refcount
 * but takes over the reference (removing it from the queue). If the packet is
 * sequenced (i.e. needs to be ACKed by the client), the transmitter thread
 * sets-up the timeout and adds the packet to the pending set before starting
 * to transmit it. As the timeout is handled by a reaper task, no additional
 * reference for it is needed. After the transmit is done, the reference held
 * by the transmitter thread is dropped. If the packet is unsequenced (i.e.
 * does not need an ACK), the packet is completed by the transmitter thread
 * before dropping that reference.
 *
 * On receival of an ACK, the receiver thread removes and obtains the
 * reference to the packet from the pending set. The receiver thread will then
 * complete the packet and drop its reference.
 *
 * On receival of a NAK, the receiver thread re-submits all currently pending
 * packets.
 *
 * Packet timeouts are detected by the timeout reaper. This is a task,
 * scheduled depending on the earliest packet timeout expiration date,
 * checking all currently pending packets if their timeout has expired. If the
 * timeout of a packet has expired, it is re-submitted and the number of tries
 * of this packet is incremented. If this number reaches its limit, the packet
 * will be completed with a failure.
 *
 * On transmission failure (such as repeated packet timeouts), the completion
 * callback is immediately run by on thread on which the error was detected.
 *
 * To ensure that a packet eventually leaves the system it is marked as
 * "locked" directly before it is going to be completed or when it is
 * canceled. Marking a packet as "locked" has the effect that passing and
 * creating new references of the packet is disallowed. This means that the
 * packet cannot be added to the queue, the pending set, and the timeout, or
 * be picked up by the transmitter thread or receiver thread. To remove a
 * packet from the system it has to be marked as locked and subsequently all
 * references from the data structures (queue, pending) have to be removed.
 * References held by threads will eventually be dropped automatically as
 * their execution progresses.
 *
 * Note that the packet completion callback is, in case of success and for a
 * sequenced packet, guaranteed to run on the receiver thread, thus providing
 * a way to reliably identify responses to the packet. The packet completion
 * callback is only run once and it does not indicate that the packet has
 * fully left the system (for this, one should rely on the release method,
 * triggered when the reference count of the packet reaches zero). In case of
 * re-submission (and with somewhat unlikely timing), it may be possible that
 * the packet is being re-transmitted while the completion callback runs.
 * Completion will occur both on success and internal error, as well as when
 * the packet is canceled.
 *
 * >> Flags <<
 *
 * Flags are used to indicate the state and progression of a packet. Some flags
 * have stricter guarantees than other:
 *
 * - locked
 *   Indicates if the packet is locked. If the packet is locked, passing and/or
 *   creating additional references to the packet is forbidden. The packet thus
 *   may not be queued, dequeued, or removed or added to the pending set. Note
 *   that the packet state flags may still change (e.g. it may be marked as
 *   ACKed, transmitted, ...).
 *
 * - completed
 *   Indicates if the packet completion callback has been executed or is about
 *   to be executed. This flag is used to ensure that the packet completion
 *   callback is only run once.
 *
 * - queued
 *   Indicates if a packet is present in the submission queue or not. This flag
 *   must only be modified with the queue lock held, and must be coherent to the
 *   presence of the packet in the queue.
 *
 * - pending
 *   Indicates if a packet is present in the set of pending packets or not.
 *   This flag must only be modified with the pending lock held, and must be
 *   coherent to the presence of the packet in the pending set.
 *
 * - transmitting
 *   Indicates if the packet is currently transmitting. In case of
 *   re-transmissions, it is only safe to wait on the "transmitted" completion
 *   after this flag has been set. The completion will be set both in success
 *   and error case.
 *
 * - transmitted
 *   Indicates if the packet has been transmitted. This flag is not cleared by
 *   the system, thus it indicates the first transmission only.
 *
 * - acked
 *   Indicates if the packet has been acknowledged by the client. There are no
 *   other guarantees given. For example, the packet may still be canceled
 *   and/or the completion may be triggered an error even though this bit is
 *   set. Rely on the status provided to the completion callback instead.
 *
 * - canceled
 *   Indicates if the packet has been canceled from the outside. There are no
 *   other guarantees given. Specifically, the packet may be completed by
 *   another part of the system before the cancellation attempts to complete it.
 *
 * >> General Notes <<
 *
 * - To avoid deadlocks, if both queue and pending locks are required, the
 *   pending lock must be acquired before the queue lock.
 *
 * - The packet priority must be accessed only while holding the queue lock.
 *
 * - The packet timestamp must be accessed only while holding the pending
 *   lock.
