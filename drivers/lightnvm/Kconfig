	  Say Y here to get to enable Open-channel SSDs.

	  Open-Channel SSDs implement a set of extension to SSDs, that
	  exposes direct access to the underlying non-volatile memory.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled
	  only do this if you know what you are doing.

	  This code is deprecated and will be removed in Linux 5.15.

config NVM_PBLK
	tristate "Physical Block Device Open-Channel SSD target"
	select CRC32
	help
	  Allows an open-channel SSD to be exposed as a block device to the
	  host. The target assumes the device exposes raw flash and must be
	  explicitly managed by the host.

	  Please note the disk format is considered EXPERIMENTAL for now.

if NVM_PBLK

config NVM_PBLK_DEBUG
	bool "PBlk Debug Support"
	default n
	help
	  Enables debug support for pblk. This includes extra checks, more
	  vocal error messages, and extra tracking fields in the pblk sysfs
	  entries.
