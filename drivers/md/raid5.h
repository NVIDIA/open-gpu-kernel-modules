/*
 *
 * Each stripe contains one buffer per device.  Each buffer can be in
 * one of a number of states stored in "flags".  Changes between
 * these states happen *almost* exclusively under the protection of the
 * STRIPE_ACTIVE flag.  Some very specific changes can happen in bi_end_io, and
 * these are not protected by STRIPE_ACTIVE.
 *
 * The flag bits that are used to represent these states are:
 *   R5_UPTODATE and R5_LOCKED
 *
 * State Empty == !UPTODATE, !LOCK
 *        We have no data, and there is no active request
 * State Want == !UPTODATE, LOCK
 *        A read request is being submitted for this block
 * State Dirty == UPTODATE, LOCK
 *        Some new data is in this buffer, and it is being written out
 * State Clean == UPTODATE, !LOCK
 *        We have valid data which is the same as on disc
 *
 * The possible state transitions are:
 *
 *  Empty -> Want   - on read or write to get old data for  parity calc
 *  Empty -> Dirty  - on compute_parity to satisfy write/sync request.
 *  Empty -> Clean  - on compute_block when computing a block for failed drive
 *  Want  -> Empty  - on failed read
 *  Want  -> Clean  - on successful completion of read request
 *  Dirty -> Clean  - on successful completion of write request
 *  Dirty -> Clean  - on failed write
 *  Clean -> Dirty  - on compute_parity to satisfy write/sync (RECONSTRUCT or RMW)
 *
 * The Want->Empty, Want->Clean, Dirty->Clean, transitions
 * all happen in b_end_io at interrupt time.
 * Each sets the Uptodate bit before releasing the Lock bit.
 * This leaves one multi-stage transition:
 *    Want->Dirty->Clean
 * This is safe because thinking that a Clean buffer is actually dirty
 * will at worst delay some action, and the stripe will be scheduled
 * for attention after the transition is complete.
 *
 * There is one possibility that is not covered by these states.  That
 * is if one drive has failed and there is a spare being rebuilt.  We
 * can't distinguish between a clean block that has been generated
 * from parity calculations, and a clean block that has been
 * successfully written to the spare ( or to parity when resyncing).
 * To distinguish these states we have a stripe bit STRIPE_INSYNC that
 * is set whenever a write is scheduled to the spare, or to the parity
 * disc if there is no spare.  A sync request clears this bit, and
 * when we find it set with no buffers locked, we know the sync is
 * complete.
 *
 * Buffers for the md device that arrive via make_request are attached
 * to the appropriate stripe in one of two lists linked on b_reqnext.
 * One list (bh_read) for read requests, one (bh_write) for write.
 * There should never be more than one buffer on the two lists
 * together, but we are not guaranteed of that so we allow for more.
 *
 * If a buffer is on the read list when the associated cache buffer is
 * Uptodate, the data is copied into the read buffer and it's b_end_io
 * routine is called.  This may happen in the end_request routine only
 * if the buffer has just successfully been read.  end_request should
 * remove the buffers from the list and then set the Uptodate bit on
 * the buffer.  Other threads may do this only if they first check
 * that the Uptodate bit is set.  Once they have checked that they may
 * take buffers off the read queue.
 *
 * When a buffer on the write list is committed for write it is copied
 * into the cache buffer, which is then marked dirty, and moved onto a
 * third list, the written list (bh_written).  Once both the parity
 * block and the cached buffer are successfully written, any buffer on
 * a written list can be returned with b_end_io.
 *
 * The write list and read list both act as fifos.  The read list,
 * write list and written list are protected by the device_lock.
 * The device_lock is only for list manipulations and will only be
 * held for a very short time.  It can be claimed from interrupts.
 *
 *
 * Stripes in the stripe cache can be on one of two lists (or on
 * neither).  The "inactive_list" contains stripes which are not
 * currently being used for any request.  They can freely be reused
 * for another stripe.  The "handle_list" contains stripes that need
 * to be handled in some way.  Both of these are fifo queues.  Each
 * stripe is also (potentially) linked to a hash bucket in the hash
 * table so that it can be found by sector number.  Stripes that are
 * not hashed must be on the inactive_list, and will normally be at
 * the front.  All stripes start life this way.
 *
 * The inactive_list, handle_list and hash bucket lists are all protected by the
 * device_lock.
 *  - stripes have a reference counter. If count==0, they are on a list.
 *  - If a stripe might need handling, STRIPE_HANDLE is set.
 *  - When refcount reaches zero, then if STRIPE_HANDLE it is put on
 *    handle_list else inactive_list
 *
 * This, combined with the fact that STRIPE_HANDLE is only ever
 * cleared while a stripe has a non-zero count means that if the
 * refcount is 0 and STRIPE_HANDLE is set, then it is on the
 * handle_list and if recount is 0 and STRIPE_HANDLE is not set, then
 * the stripe is on inactive_list.
 *
 * The possible transitions are:
 *  activate an unhashed/inactive stripe (get_active_stripe())
 *     lockdev check-hash unlink-stripe cnt++ clean-stripe hash-stripe unlockdev
 *  activate a hashed, possibly active stripe (get_active_stripe())
 *     lockdev check-hash if(!cnt++)unlink-stripe unlockdev
 *  attach a request to an active stripe (add_stripe_bh())
 *     lockdev attach-buffer unlockdev
 *  handle a stripe (handle_stripe())
 *     setSTRIPE_ACTIVE,  clrSTRIPE_HANDLE ...
 *		(lockdev check-buffers unlockdev) ..
 *		change-state ..
 *		record io/ops needed clearSTRIPE_ACTIVE schedule io/ops
 *  release an active stripe (release_stripe())
 *     lockdev if (!--cnt) { if  STRIPE_HANDLE, add to handle_list else add to inactive-list } unlockdev
 *
 * The refcount counts each thread that have activated the stripe,
 * plus raid5d if it is handling it, plus one for each active request
 * on a cached buffer, and plus one if the stripe is undergoing stripe
 * operations.
 *
 * The stripe operations are:
 * -copying data between the stripe cache and user application buffers
 * -computing blocks to save a disk access, or to recover a missing block
 * -updating the parity on a write operation (reconstruct write and
 *  read-modify-write)
 * -checking parity correctness
 * -running i/o to disk
 * These operations are carried out by raid5_run_ops which uses the async_tx
 * api to (optionally) offload operations to dedicated hardware engines.
 * When requesting an operation handle_stripe sets the pending bit for the
 * operation and increments the count.  raid5_run_ops is then run whenever
 * the count is non-zero.
 * There are some critical dependencies between the operations that prevent some
 * from being requested while another is in flight.
 * 1/ Parity check operations destroy the in cache version of the parity block,
 *    so we prevent parity dependent operations like writes and compute_blocks
 *    from starting while a check is in progress.  Some dma engines can perform
 *    the check without damaging the parity block, in these cases the parity
 *    block is re-marked up to date (assuming the check was successful) and is
 *    not re-read from disk.
 * 2/ When a write operation is requested we immediately lock the affected
 *    blocks, and mark them as not up to date.  This causes new read requests
 *    to be held off, as well as parity checks and compute block operations.
 * 3/ Once a compute block operation has been requested handle_stripe treats
 *    that block as if it is up to date.  raid5_run_ops guaruntees that any
 *    operation that is dependent on the compute block result is initiated after
 *    the compute block completes.
