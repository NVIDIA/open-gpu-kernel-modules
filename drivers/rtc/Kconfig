	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup and resume"
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using
	  the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid
	  unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "RTC used to set the system time"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used to (re)initialize the system
	  clock, usually rtc0. Initialization is done when the system
	  starts up, and when it resumes from a low power state. This
	  device should record time in UTC, since the kernel won't do
	  timezone correction.

	  This clock should be battery-backed, so that it reads the correct
	  time when the system boots from a power-off state. Otherwise, your
	  system will need an external clock source (like an NTP server).

	  If the clock you specify here is not battery backed, it may still
	  be useful to reinitialize system time when resuming from system
	  sleep states. Do not specify an RTC here unless it stays powered
	  during all this system's supported sleep states.

config RTC_SYSTOHC
	bool "Set the RTC time based on NTP synchronization"
	default y

	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be stored

	  minutes if userspace reports synchronized NTP status.

	  The RTC device used for NTP synchronization. The main difference
	  between RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE and RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE is that this
	  one can sleep when setting time, because it runs in the workqueue
	  context.

config RTC_DEBUG

	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev
	  interfaces, which "udev" sets up as /dev/rtc0 through
	  /dev/rtcN.

	  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one of these
	  can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name
	  expected by "hwclock" and some other programs. Recent
	  versions of "udev" are known to set up the symlink for you.

	  The emulation code will read the time from the hardware
	  clock several times per second, please enable this option
	  only if you know that you really need it.
