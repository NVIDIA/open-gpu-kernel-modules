config ARM_CPUIDLE
	bool "Generic ARM/ARM64 CPU idle Driver"
	select DT_IDLE_STATES
	select CPU_IDLE_MULTIPLE_DRIVERS
	help
	  Select this to enable generic cpuidle driver for ARM.
	  It provides a generic idle driver whose idle states are configured
	  at run-time through DT nodes. The CPUidle suspend backend is
	  initialized by calling the CPU operations init idle hook
	  provided by architecture code.

config ARM_PSCI_CPUIDLE
	bool "PSCI CPU idle Driver"
	depends on ARM_PSCI_FW
	select DT_IDLE_STATES
	select CPU_IDLE_MULTIPLE_DRIVERS
	help
	  Select this to enable PSCI firmware based CPUidle driver for ARM.
	  It provides an idle driver that is capable of detecting and
	  managing idle states through the PSCI firmware interface.

config ARM_PSCI_CPUIDLE_DOMAIN
	bool "PSCI CPU idle Domain"
	depends on ARM_PSCI_CPUIDLE
	depends on PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF
	default y
	help
	  Select this to enable the PSCI based CPUidle driver to use PM domains,
	  which is needed to support the hierarchical DT based layout of the
	  idle states.

	select ARM_CPU_SUSPEND
	select CPU_IDLE_MULTIPLE_DRIVERS
	select DT_IDLE_STATES
	help
	  Select this option to enable CPU idle driver for big.LITTLE based
	  ARM systems. Driver manages CPUs coordination through MCPM and
	  define different C-states for little and big cores through the
	  multiple CPU idle drivers infrastructure.

config ARM_CLPS711X_CPUIDLE
