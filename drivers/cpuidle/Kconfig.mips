	  Select this option to enable processor idle state management
	  through cpuidle for systems built around the MIPS Coherent
	  Processing System (CPS) architecture. In order to make use of
	  the deepest idle states you will need to ensure that you are
	  also using the CONFIG_MIPS_CPS SMP implementation.
