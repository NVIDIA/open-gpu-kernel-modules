/**
 * DOC: Coupled cpuidle states
 *
 * On some ARM SMP SoCs (OMAP4460, Tegra 2, and probably more), the
 * cpus cannot be independently powered down, either due to
 * sequencing restrictions (on Tegra 2, cpu 0 must be the last to
 * power down), or due to HW bugs (on OMAP4460, a cpu powering up
 * will corrupt the gic state unless the other cpu runs a work
 * around).  Each cpu has a power state that it can enter without
 * coordinating with the other cpu (usually Wait For Interrupt, or
 * WFI), and one or more "coupled" power states that affect blocks
 * shared between the cpus (L2 cache, interrupt controller, and
 * sometimes the whole SoC).  Entering a coupled power state must
 * be tightly controlled on both cpus.
 *
 * This file implements a solution, where each cpu will wait in the
 * WFI state until all cpus are ready to enter a coupled state, at
 * which point the coupled state function will be called on all
 * cpus at approximately the same time.
 *
 * Once all cpus are ready to enter idle, they are woken by an smp
 * cross call.  At this point, there is a chance that one of the
 * cpus will find work to do, and choose not to enter idle.  A
 * final pass is needed to guarantee that all cpus will call the
 * power state enter function at the same time.  During this pass,
 * each cpu will increment the ready counter, and continue once the
 * ready counter matches the number of online coupled cpus.  If any
 * cpu exits idle, the other cpus will decrement their counter and
 * retry.
 *
 * requested_state stores the deepest coupled idle state each cpu
 * is ready for.  It is assumed that the states are indexed from
 * shallowest (highest power, lowest exit latency) to deepest
 * (lowest power, highest exit latency).  The requested_state
 * variable is not locked.  It is only written from the cpu that
 * it stores (or by the on/offlining cpu if that cpu is offline),
 * and only read after all the cpus are ready for the coupled idle
 * state are are no longer updating it.
 *
 * Three atomic counters are used.  alive_count tracks the number
 * of cpus in the coupled set that are currently or soon will be
 * online.  waiting_count tracks the number of cpus that are in
 * the waiting loop, in the ready loop, or in the coupled idle state.
 * ready_count tracks the number of cpus that are in the ready loop
 * or in the coupled idle state.
 *
 * To use coupled cpuidle states, a cpuidle driver must:
 *
 *    Set struct cpuidle_device.coupled_cpus to the mask of all
 *    coupled cpus, usually the same as cpu_possible_mask if all cpus
 *    are part of the same cluster.  The coupled_cpus mask must be
 *    set in the struct cpuidle_device for each cpu.
 *
 *    Set struct cpuidle_device.safe_state to a state that is not a
 *    coupled state.  This is usually WFI.
 *
 *    Set CPUIDLE_FLAG_COUPLED in struct cpuidle_state.flags for each
 *    state that affects multiple cpus.
 *
 *    Provide a struct cpuidle_state.enter function for each state
 *    that affects multiple cpus.  This function is guaranteed to be
 *    called on all cpus at approximately the same time.  The driver
 *    should ensure that the cpus all abort together if any cpu tries
 *    to abort once the function is called.  The function should return
 *    with interrupts still disabled.
