	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for the "System Device
	  Controller", an i8042 carrying microcode to manage a
	  few miscellaneous devices on some Hewlett Packard systems.
	  The SDC itself contains a 10ms resolution timer/clock capable
	  of delivering interrupts on a periodic and one-shot basis.
	  The SDC may also be connected to a battery-backed real-time
	  clock, a basic audio waveform generator, and an HP-HIL Master
	  Link Controller serving up to seven input devices.

	  By itself this option is rather useless, but enabling it will
	  enable selection of drivers for the abovementioned devices.
	  It is, however, incompatible with the old, reliable HIL keyboard
	  driver, and the new HIL driver is experimental, so if you plan
	  to use a HIL keyboard as your primary keyboard, you may wish
	  to keep using that driver until the new HIL drivers have had
	  more testing.

	  allocating minor 1 (that historically corresponds to /dev/psaux)
	  first. To bind this driver to a serio port use sysfs interface:
