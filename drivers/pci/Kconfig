	   This allows device drivers to enable MSI (Message Signaled
	   Interrupts).  Message Signaled Interrupts enable a device to
	   generate an interrupt using an inbound Memory Write on its
	   PCI bus instead of asserting a device IRQ pin.

	   Use of PCI MSI interrupts can be disabled at kernel boot time
	   by using the 'pci=nomsi' option.  This disables MSI for the
	   entire system.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want the PCI core to detect if PCI resource
	  re-allocation needs to be enabled. You can always use pci=realloc=on
	  or pci=realloc=off to override it.  It will automatically
	  re-allocate PCI resources if SR-IOV BARs have not been allocated by

config PCI_PASID
	bool "PCI PASID support"
	select PCI_ATS
	help
	  Process Address Space Identifiers (PASIDs) can be used by PCI devices
	  to access more than one IO address space at the same time. To make

	  the hierarchy where peer-to-peer DMA is guaranteed by the PCI
	  specification to work (ie. anything below a single PCI bridge).

	  Many PCIe root complexes do not support P2P transactions and
	  it's hard to tell which support it at all, so at this time,
	  P2P DMA transactions must be between devices behind the same root

	help
	  MPS (Max Payload Size) and MRRS (Max Read Request Size) are PCIe
	  device parameters that affect performance and the ability to
	  support hotplug and peer-to-peer DMA.

	  The following choices set the MPS and MRRS optimization strategy
	  at compile-time.  The choices are the same as those offered for
	  the kernel command-line parameter 'pci', i.e.,
	  'pci=pcie_bus_tune_off', 'pci=pcie_bus_safe',
	  'pci=pcie_bus_perf', and 'pci=pcie_bus_peer2peer'.

	  This is a compile-time setting and can be overridden by the above
	  command-line parameters.  If unsure, choose PCIE_BUS_DEFAULT.

config PCIE_BUS_TUNE_OFF
	bool "Tune Off"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Use the BIOS defaults; don't touch MPS at all.  This is the same
	  as booting with 'pci=pcie_bus_tune_off'.

config PCIE_BUS_DEFAULT
	bool "Default"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Default choice; ensure that the MPS matches upstream bridge.

config PCIE_BUS_SAFE
	bool "Safe"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Use largest MPS that boot-time devices support.  If you have a
	  closed system with no possibility of adding new devices, this
	  will use the largest MPS that's supported by all devices.  This
	  is the same as booting with 'pci=pcie_bus_safe'.

config PCIE_BUS_PERFORMANCE
	bool "Performance"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Use MPS and MRRS for best performance.  Ensure that a given
	  device's MPS is no larger than its parent MPS, which allows us to
	  keep all switches/bridges to the max MPS supported by their
	  parent.  This is the same as booting with 'pci=pcie_bus_perf'.

config PCIE_BUS_PEER2PEER
	bool "Peer2peer"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Set MPS = 128 for all devices.  MPS configuration effected by the
	  other options could cause the MPS on one root port to be
	  different than that of the MPS on another, which may cause
	  hot-added devices or peer-to-peer DMA to fail.  Set MPS to the
	  smallest possible value (128B) system-wide to avoid these issues.
	  This is the same as booting with 'pci=pcie_bus_peer2peer'.
