config PCI_ENDPOINT
	bool "PCI Endpoint Support"
	depends on HAVE_PCI
	help
	   Enable this configuration option to support configurable PCI
	   endpoint. This should be enabled if the platform has a PCI
	   controller that can operate in endpoint mode.

	   Enabling this option will build the endpoint library, which
	   includes endpoint controller library and endpoint function
	   library.

	   If in doubt, say "N" to disable Endpoint support.

config PCI_ENDPOINT_CONFIGFS
	bool "PCI Endpoint Configfs Support"
	depends on PCI_ENDPOINT
	select CONFIGFS_FS
	help
	   This will enable the configfs entry that can be used to
	   configure the endpoint function and used to bind the
	   function with a endpoint controller.
