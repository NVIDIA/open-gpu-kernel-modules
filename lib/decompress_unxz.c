/*
 * Important notes about in-place decompression
 *
 * At least on x86, the kernel is decompressed in place: the compressed data
 * is placed to the end of the output buffer, and the decompressor overwrites
 * most of the compressed data. There must be enough safety margin to
 * guarantee that the write position is always behind the read position.
 *
 * The safety margin for XZ with LZMA2 or BCJ+LZMA2 is calculated below.
 * Note that the margin with XZ is bigger than with Deflate (gzip)!
 *
 * The worst case for in-place decompression is that the beginning of
 * the file is compressed extremely well, and the rest of the file is
 * uncompressible. Thus, we must look for worst-case expansion when the
 * compressor is encoding uncompressible data.
 *
 * The structure of the .xz file in case of a compresed kernel is as follows.
 * Sizes (as bytes) of the fields are in parenthesis.
 *
 *    Stream Header (12)
 *    Block Header:
 *      Block Header (8-12)
 *      Compressed Data (N)
 *      Block Padding (0-3)
 *      CRC32 (4)
 *    Index (8-20)
 *    Stream Footer (12)
 *
 * Normally there is exactly one Block, but let's assume that there are
 * 2-4 Blocks just in case. Because Stream Header and also Block Header
 * of the first Block don't make the decompressor produce any uncompressed
 * data, we can ignore them from our calculations. Block Headers of possible
 * additional Blocks have to be taken into account still. With these
 * assumptions, it is safe to assume that the total header overhead is
 * less than 128 bytes.
 *
 * Compressed Data contains LZMA2 or BCJ+LZMA2 encoded data. Since BCJ
 * doesn't change the size of the data, it is enough to calculate the
 * safety margin for LZMA2.
 *
 * LZMA2 stores the data in chunks. Each chunk has a header whose size is
 * a maximum of 6 bytes, but to get round 2^n numbers, let's assume that
 * the maximum chunk header size is 8 bytes. After the chunk header, there
 * may be up to 64 KiB of actual payload in the chunk. Often the payload is
 * quite a bit smaller though; to be safe, let's assume that an average
 * chunk has only 32 KiB of payload.
 *
 * The maximum uncompressed size of the payload is 2 MiB. The minimum
 * uncompressed size of the payload is in practice never less than the
 * payload size itself. The LZMA2 format would allow uncompressed size
 * to be less than the payload size, but no sane compressor creates such
 * files. LZMA2 supports storing uncompressible data in uncompressed form,
 * so there's never a need to create payloads whose uncompressed size is
 * smaller than the compressed size.
 *
 * The assumption, that the uncompressed size of the payload is never
 * smaller than the payload itself, is valid only when talking about
 * the payload as a whole. It is possible that the payload has parts where
 * the decompressor consumes more input than it produces output. Calculating
 * the worst case for this would be tricky. Instead of trying to do that,
 * let's simply make sure that the decompressor never overwrites any bytes
 * of the payload which it is currently reading.
 *
 * Now we have enough information to calculate the safety margin. We need
 *   - 128 bytes for the .xz file format headers;
 *   - 8 bytes per every 32 KiB of uncompressed size (one LZMA2 chunk header
 *     per chunk, each chunk having average payload size of 32 KiB); and
 *   - 64 KiB (biggest possible LZMA2 chunk payload size) to make sure that
 *     the decompressor never overwrites anything from the LZMA2 chunk
 *     payload it is currently reading.
 *
 * We get the following formula:
 *
 *    safety_margin = 128 + uncompressed_size * 8 / 32768 + 65536
 *                  = 128 + (uncompressed_size >> 12) + 65536
 *
 * For comparison, according to arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c, the
 * equivalent formula for Deflate is this:
 *
 *    safety_margin = 18 + (uncompressed_size >> 12) + 32768
 *
 * Thus, when updating Deflate-only in-place kernel decompressor to
 * support XZ, the fixed overhead has to be increased from 18+32768 bytes
 * to 128+65536 bytes.
