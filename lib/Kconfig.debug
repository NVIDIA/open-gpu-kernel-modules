config PRINTK_TIME
	bool "Show timing information on printks"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Selecting this option causes time stamps of the printk()
	  messages to be added to the output of the syslog() system
	  call and at the console.

	  The timestamp is always recorded internally, and exported
	  to /dev/kmsg. This flag just specifies if the timestamp should
	  be included, not that the timestamp is recorded.

	  The behavior is also controlled by the kernel command line
	  parameter printk.time=1. See Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst

config PRINTK_CALLER
	bool "Show caller information on printks"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Selecting this option causes printk() to add a caller "thread id" (if
	  in task context) or a caller "processor id" (if not in task context)
	  to every message.

	  This option is intended for environments where multiple threads
	  concurrently call printk() for many times, for it is difficult to
	  interpret without knowing where these lines (or sometimes individual
	  line which was divided into multiple lines due to race) came from.

	  Since toggling after boot makes the code racy, currently there is
	  no option to enable/disable at the kernel command line parameter or
	  sysfs interface.

config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "7"
	help
	  Default loglevel to determine what will be printed on the console.

	  Setting a default here is equivalent to passing in loglevel=<x> in
	  the kernel bootargs. loglevel=<x> continues to override whatever
	  value is specified here as well.

	  Note: This does not affect the log level of un-prefixed printk()
	  usage in the kernel. That is controlled by the MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	  option.

config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET
	int "quiet console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "4"
	help
	  loglevel to use when "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline.

	  When "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline this loglevel
	  will be used as the loglevel. IOW passing "quiet" will be the
	  equivalent of passing "loglevel=<CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET>"

config MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default message log level (1-7)"
	range 1 7
	default "4"
	help
	  Default log level for printk statements with no specified priority.

	  This was hard-coded to KERN_WARNING since at least 2.6.10 but folks
	  that are auditing their logs closely may want to set it to a lower
	  priority.

	  Note: This does not affect what message level gets printed on the console
	  by default. To change that, use loglevel=<x> in the kernel bootargs,
	  or pick a different CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT configuration value.

config BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY
	bool "Delay each boot printk message by N milliseconds"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && PRINTK && GENERIC_CALIBRATE_DELAY
	help
	  This build option allows you to read kernel boot messages
	  by inserting a short delay after each one.  The delay is
	  specified in milliseconds on the kernel command line,
	  using "boot_delay=N".

	  It is likely that you would also need to use "lpj=M" to preset
	  the "loops per jiffie" value.
	  See a previous boot log for the "lpj" value to use for your
	  system, and then set "lpj=M" before setting "boot_delay=N".
	  NOTE:  Using this option may adversely affect SMP systems.
	  I.e., processors other than the first one may not boot up.
	  BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY also may cause LOCKUP_DETECTOR to detect
	  what it believes to be lockup conditions.

config DYNAMIC_DEBUG
	bool "Enable dynamic printk() support"
	default n
	depends on PRINTK
	depends on (DEBUG_FS || PROC_FS)
	select DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CORE
	help

	  Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not
	  otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be
	  enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file,
	  function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism
	  implicitly compiles in all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls, which
	  enlarges the kernel text size by about 2%.

	  If a source file is compiled with DEBUG flag set, any
	  pr_debug() calls in it are enabled by default, but can be
	  disabled at runtime as below.  Note that DEBUG flag is
	  turned on by many CONFIG_*DEBUG* options.

	  Usage:

	  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file,
	  which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem or procfs.
	  Thus, the debugfs or procfs filesystem must first be mounted before
	  making use of this feature.
	  We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This
	  file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The
	  format for each line of the file is:

		filename:lineno [module]function flags format

	  filename : source file of the debug statement
	  lineno : line number of the debug statement
	  module : module that contains the debug statement
	  function : function that contains the debug statement
	  flags : '=p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing
	  format : the format used for the debug statement

	  From a live system:

		nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control
		# filename:lineno [module]function flags format
		fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx =_ "__put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012"
		fs/aio.c:248 [aio]ioctx_alloc =_ "ENOMEM:\040nr_events\040too\040high\012"
		fs/aio.c:1770 [aio]sys_io_cancel =_ "calling\040cancel\012"

	  Example usage:

		// enable the message at line 1603 of file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in the NFS server module
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'module nfsd +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// disable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process -p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

	  See Documentation/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.rst for additional
	  information.

config DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CORE
	bool "Enable core function of dynamic debug support"
	depends on PRINTK
	depends on (DEBUG_FS || PROC_FS)
	help
	  Enable core functional support of dynamic debug. It is useful
	  when you want to tie dynamic debug to your kernel modules with
	  DYNAMIC_DEBUG_MODULE defined for each of them, especially for
	  the case of embedded system where the kernel image size is
	  sensitive for people.

config SYMBOLIC_ERRNAME
	bool "Support symbolic error names in printf"
	default y if PRINTK
	help
	  If you say Y here, the kernel's printf implementation will
	  be able to print symbolic error names such as ENOSPC instead
	  of the number 28. It makes the kernel image slightly larger
	  (about 3KB), but can make the kernel logs easier to read.

config DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
	bool "Verbose BUG() reporting (adds 70K)" if DEBUG_KERNEL && EXPERT
	depends on BUG && (GENERIC_BUG || HAVE_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE)
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to make BUG() panics output the file name and line number
	  of the BUG call as well as the EIP and oops trace.  This aids

	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  This adds debug symbols to the kernel and modules (gcc -g), and
	  is needed if you intend to use kernel crashdump or binary object
	  tools like crash, kgdb, LKCD, gdb, etc on the kernel.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to debug the kernel.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED
	bool "Reduce debugging information"
	help
	  If you say Y here gcc is instructed to generate less debugging
	  information for structure types. This means that tools that
	  need full debugging information (like kgdb or systemtap) won't
	  be happy. But if you merely need debugging information to
	  resolve line numbers there is no loss. Advantage is that
	  build directory object sizes shrink dramatically over a full
	  DEBUG_INFO build and compile times are reduced too.
	  Only works with newer gcc versions.

config DEBUG_INFO_COMPRESSED
	bool "Compressed debugging information"
	depends on $(cc-option,-gz=zlib)
	depends on $(ld-option,--compress-debug-sections=zlib)
	help
	  Compress the debug information using zlib.  Requires GCC 5.0+ or Clang
	  5.0+, binutils 2.26+, and zlib.

	  Users of dpkg-deb via scripts/package/builddeb may find an increase in
	  size of their debug .deb packages with this config set, due to the
	  debug info being compressed with zlib, then the object files being
	  recompressed with a different compression scheme. But this is still
	  preferable to setting $KDEB_COMPRESS to "none" which would be even
	  larger.

config DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT
	bool "Produce split debuginfo in .dwo files"
	depends on $(cc-option,-gsplit-dwarf)
	help
	  Generate debug info into separate .dwo files. This significantly
	  reduces the build directory size for builds with DEBUG_INFO,
	  because it stores the information only once on disk in .dwo
	  files instead of multiple times in object files and executables.
	  In addition the debug information is also compressed.

	  Requires recent gcc (4.7+) and recent gdb/binutils.
	  Any tool that packages or reads debug information would need
	  to know about the .dwo files and include them.
	  Incompatible with older versions of ccache.

	help
	  The implicit default version of DWARF debug info produced by a
	  toolchain changes over time.

	  This can break consumers of the debug info that haven't upgraded to
	  support newer revisions, and prevent testing newer versions, but
	  those should be less common scenarios.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4
	bool "Generate DWARF Version 4 debuginfo"
	help
	  Generate DWARF v4 debug info. This requires gcc 4.5+ and gdb 7.0+.

	  If you have consumers of DWARF debug info that are not ready for
	  newer revisions of DWARF, you may wish to choose this or have your
	  config select this.

	depends on !DEBUG_INFO_BTF
	help
	  Generate DWARF v5 debug info. Requires binutils 2.35.2, gcc 5.0+ (gcc
	  5.0+ accepts the -gdwarf-5 flag but only had partial support for some
	  draft features until 7.0), and gdb 8.0+.

	  Changes to the structure of debug info in Version 5 allow for around
	  15-18% savings in resulting image and debug info section sizes as
	  compared to DWARF Version 4. DWARF Version 5 standardizes previous
	  extensions such as accelerators for symbol indexing and the format
	  for fission (.dwo/.dwp) files. Users may not want to select this

	  This option will install uapi headers (headers exported to user-space)

	  This is unneeded for building the kernel itself, but needed for some
	  user-space program samples. It is also needed by some features such
	  as uapi header sanity checks.

config DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH
	bool "Enable full Section mismatch analysis"
	help
	  The section mismatch analysis checks if there are illegal
	  references from one section to another section.
	  During linktime or runtime, some sections are dropped;
	  any use of code/data previously in these sections would
	  most likely result in an oops.
	  In the code, functions and variables are annotated with
	  __init,, etc. (see the full list in include/linux/init.h),
	  which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections.
	  The section mismatch analysis is always performed after a full
	  kernel build, and enabling this option causes the following
	  additional step to occur:
	  - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc commands.
	    When inlining a function annotated with __init in a non-init
	    function, we would lose the section information and thus
	    the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.
	    This option tells gcc to inline less (but it does result in
	    a larger kernel).

config SECTION_MISMATCH_WARN_ONLY
	bool "Make section mismatch errors non-fatal"

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on

	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes

	  Some parts of the kernel contain bugs relating to their use of
	  cryptographically secure random numbers before it's actually possible
	  to generate those numbers securely. This setting ensures that these
	  flaws don't go unnoticed, by enabling a message, should this ever
	  occur. This will allow people with obscure setups to know when things
	  are going wrong, so that they might contact developers about fixing
	  it.

	  Unfortunately, on some models of some architectures getting
	  a fully seeded CRNG is extremely difficult, and so this can
	  result in dmesg getting spammed for a surprisingly long
	  time.  This is really bad from a security perspective, and
	  so architecture maintainers really need to do what they can
	  to get the CRNG seeded sooner after the system is booted.
	  However, since users cannot do anything actionable to
	  address this, by default the kernel will issue only a single
	  warning for the first use of unseeded randomness.

	  Say Y here if you want to receive warnings for all uses of

	  live on past the point at which a driver decides to drop it's
	  initial reference to the kobject gained on allocation.  An
	  example of this would be a struct device which has just been
	  unregistered.

	  However, some buggy drivers assume that after such an operation,
	  the memory backing the kobject can be immediately freed.  This
	  goes completely against the principles of a refcounted object.

	  If you say Y here, the kernel will delay the release of kobjects
	  on the last reference count to improve the visibility of this
	  kind of kobject release bug.

	  If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early
	  on boot and the crashing machine has a FireWire port, you can use
	  this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine
	  over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394
	  specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.

	  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using
	  firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb.
	  Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.

	  Usage:

	  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize
	  all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.

	  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling
	  devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all
	  devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.

	  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack
	  in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.

	  Test the kernel's module loading mechanism: kmod. kmod implements
	  support to load modules using the Linux kernel's usermode helper.
	  This test provides a series of tests against kmod.

	  Although technically you can either build test_kmod as a module or
	  into the kernel we disallow building it into the kernel since
	  it stress tests request_module() and this will very likely cause
	  some issues by taking over precious threads available from other
	  module load requests, ultimately this could be fatal.
