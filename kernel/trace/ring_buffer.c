 * The ring buffer is made up of a list of pages. A separate list of pages is
 * allocated for each CPU. A writer may only write to a buffer that is
 * associated with the CPU it is currently executing on.  A reader may read
 * from any per cpu buffer.
 *
 * The reader is special. For each per cpu buffer, the reader has its own
 * reader page. When a reader has read the entire reader page, this reader
 * page is swapped with another page in the ring buffer.
 *
 * Now, as long as the writer is off the reader page, the reader can do what
 * ever it wants with that page. The writer will never write to that page
 * again (as long as it is out of the ring buffer).

 * On 32 bit machines, local64_t is very expensive. As the ring
 * buffer doesn't need all the features of a true 64 bit atomic,
 * on 32 bit, it uses these functions (64 still uses local64_t).
 *
 * For the ring buffer, 64 bit required operations for the time is
 * the following:
 *
 *  - Only need 59 bits (uses 60 to make it even).
 *  - Reads may fail if it interrupted a modification of the time stamp.
 *      It will succeed if it did not interrupt another write even if
 *      the read itself is interrupted by a write.
 *      It returns whether it was successful or not.
 *
 *  - Writes always succeed and will overwrite other writes and writes
 *      that were done by events interrupting the current write.
 *
 *  - A write followed by a read of the same time stamp will always succeed,
 *      but may not contain the same value.
 *
 *  - A cmpxchg will fail if it interrupted another write or cmpxchg.
 *      Other than that, it acts like a normal cmpxchg.
 *
 * The 60 bit time stamp is broken up by 30 bits in a top and bottom half
 *  (bottom being the least significant 30 bits of the 60 bit time stamp).
 *
 * The two most significant bits of each half holds a 2 bit counter (0-3).
 * Each update will increment this counter by one.
 * When reading the top and bottom, if the two counter bits match then the
 *  top and bottom together make a valid 60 bit number.

/*
 * Making the ring buffer lockless makes things tricky.
 * Although writes only happen on the CPU that they are on,
 * and they only need to worry about interrupts. Reads can
 * happen on any CPU.
 *
 * The reader page is always off the ring buffer, but when the
 * reader finishes with a page, it needs to swap its page with
 * a new one from the buffer. The reader needs to take from
 * the head (writes go to the tail). But if a writer is in overwrite
 * mode and wraps, it must push the head page forward.
 *
 * Here lies the problem.
 *
 * The reader must be careful to replace only the head page, and
 * not another one. As described at the top of the file in the
 * ASCII art, the reader sets its old page to point to the next
 * page after head. It then sets the page after head to point to
 * the old reader page. But if the writer moves the head page
 * during this operation, the reader could end up with the tail.
 *
 * We use cmpxchg to help prevent this race. We also do something
 * special with the page before head. We set the LSB to 1.
 *
 * When the writer must push the page forward, it will clear the
 * bit that points to the head page, move the head, and then set
 * the bit that points to the new head page.
 *
 * We also don't want an interrupt coming in and moving the head
 * page on another writer. Thus we use the second LSB to catch
 * that too. Thus:
 *
 * head->list->prev->next        bit 1          bit 0
 *                              -------        -------
 * Normal page                     0              0
 * Points to head page             0              1
 * New head page                   1              0
 *
 * Note we can not trust the prev pointer of the head page, because:
 *
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 * |    |------>|  T  |---X--->|  N  |
 * |    |<------|     |        |     |
 * +----+       +-----+        +-----+
 *   ^                           ^ |
 *   |          +-----+          | |
 *   +----------|  R  |----------+ |
 *              |     |<-----------+
 *              +-----+
 *
 * Key:  ---X-->  HEAD flag set in pointer
 *         T      Tail page
 *         R      Reader page
 *         N      Next page
 *
 * (see __rb_reserve_next() to see where this happens)
 *
 *  What the above shows is that the reader just swapped out
 *  the reader page with a page in the buffer, but before it
 *  could make the new header point back to the new page added
 *  it was preempted by a writer. The writer moved forward onto
 *  the new page added by the reader and is about to move forward
 *  again.
 *
 *  You can see, it is legitimate for the previous pointer of
 *  the head (or any page) not to point back to itself. But only
 *  temporarily.

/*
 * The lock and unlock are done within a preempt disable section.
 * The current_context per_cpu variable can only be modified
 * by the current task between lock and unlock. But it can
 * be modified more than once via an interrupt. To pass this
 * information from the lock to the unlock without having to
 * access the 'in_interrupt()' functions again (which do show
 * a bit of overhead in something as critical as function tracing,
 * we use a bitmask trick.
 *
 *  bit 1 =  NMI context
 *  bit 2 =  IRQ context
 *  bit 3 =  SoftIRQ context
 *  bit 4 =  normal context.
 *
 * This works because this is the order of contexts that can
 * preempt other contexts. A SoftIRQ never preempts an IRQ
 * context.
 *
 * When the context is determined, the corresponding bit is
 * checked and set (if it was set, then a recursion of that context
 * happened).
 *
 * On unlock, we need to clear this bit. To do so, just subtract
 * 1 from the current_context and AND it to itself.
 *
 * (binary)
 *  101 - 1 = 100
 *  101 & 100 = 100 (clearing bit zero)
 *
 *  1010 - 1 = 1001
 *  1010 & 1001 = 1000 (clearing bit 1)
 *
 * The least significant bit can be cleared this way, and it
 * just so happens that it is the same bit corresponding to
 * the current context.
 *
 * Now the TRANSITION bit breaks the above slightly. The TRANSITION bit
 * is set when a recursion is detected at the current context, and if
 * the TRANSITION bit is already set, it will fail the recursion.
 * This is needed because there's a lag between the changing of
 * interrupt context and updating the preempt count. In this case,
 * a false positive will be found. To handle this, one extra recursion
 * is allowed, and this is done by the TRANSITION bit. If the TRANSITION
 * bit is already set, then it is considered a recursion and the function
 * ends. Otherwise, the TRANSITION bit is set, and that bit is returned.
 *
 * On the trace_recursive_unlock(), the TRANSITION bit will be the first
 * to be cleared. Even if it wasn't the context that set it. That is,
 * if an interrupt comes in while NORMAL bit is set and the ring buffer
 * is called before preempt_count() is updated, since the check will
 * be on the NORMAL bit, the TRANSITION bit will then be set. If an
 * NMI then comes in, it will set the NMI bit, but when the NMI code
 * does the trace_recursive_unlock() it will clear the TRANSITION bit
 * and leave the NMI bit set. But this is fine, because the interrupt
 * code that set the TRANSITION bit will then clear the NMI bit when it
 * calls trace_recursive_unlock(). If another NMI comes in, it will
 * set the TRANSITION bit and continue.
 *
 * Note: The TRANSITION bit only handles a single transition between context.

/**
 * ring_buffer_read_page - extract a page from the ring buffer
 * @buffer: buffer to extract from
 * @data_page: the page to use allocated from ring_buffer_alloc_read_page
 * @len: amount to extract
 * @cpu: the cpu of the buffer to extract
 * @full: should the extraction only happen when the page is full.
 *
 * This function will pull out a page from the ring buffer and consume it.
 * @data_page must be the address of the variable that was returned
 * from ring_buffer_alloc_read_page. This is because the page might be used
 * to swap with a page in the ring buffer.
 *
 * for example:
 *	rpage = ring_buffer_alloc_read_page(buffer, cpu);
 *	if (IS_ERR(rpage))
 *		return PTR_ERR(rpage);
 *	ret = ring_buffer_read_page(buffer, &rpage, len, cpu, 0);
 *	if (ret >= 0)
 *		process_page(rpage, ret);
 *
 * When @full is set, the function will not return true unless
 * the writer is off the reader page.
 *
 * Note: it is up to the calling functions to handle sleeps and wakeups.
 *  The ring buffer can be used anywhere in the kernel and can not
 *  blindly call wake_up. The layer that uses the ring buffer must be
 *  responsible for that.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  >=0 if data has been transferred, returns the offset of consumed data.
 *  <0 if no data has been transferred.
