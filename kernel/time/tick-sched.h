/**
 * struct tick_sched - sched tick emulation and no idle tick control/stats
 * @sched_timer:	hrtimer to schedule the periodic tick in high
 *			resolution mode
 * @check_clocks:	Notification mechanism about clocksource changes
 * @nohz_mode:		Mode - one state of tick_nohz_mode
 * @inidle:		Indicator that the CPU is in the tick idle mode
 * @tick_stopped:	Indicator that the idle tick has been stopped
 * @idle_active:	Indicator that the CPU is actively in the tick idle mode;
 *			it is reset during irq handling phases.
 * @do_timer_lst:	CPU was the last one doing do_timer before going idle
 * @got_idle_tick:	Tick timer function has run with @inidle set
 * @last_tick:		Store the last tick expiry time when the tick
 *			timer is modified for nohz sleeps. This is necessary
 *			to resume the tick timer operation in the timeline
 *			when the CPU returns from nohz sleep.
 * @next_tick:		Next tick to be fired when in dynticks mode.
 * @idle_jiffies:	jiffies at the entry to idle for idle time accounting
 * @idle_calls:		Total number of idle calls
 * @idle_sleeps:	Number of idle calls, where the sched tick was stopped
 * @idle_entrytime:	Time when the idle call was entered
 * @idle_waketime:	Time when the idle was interrupted
 * @idle_exittime:	Time when the idle state was left
 * @idle_sleeptime:	Sum of the time slept in idle with sched tick stopped
 * @iowait_sleeptime:	Sum of the time slept in idle with sched tick stopped, with IO outstanding
 * @timer_expires:	Anticipated timer expiration time (in case sched tick is stopped)
 * @timer_expires_base:	Base time clock monotonic for @timer_expires
 * @next_timer:		Expiry time of next expiring timer for debugging purpose only
 * @tick_dep_mask:	Tick dependency mask - is set, if someone needs the tick
