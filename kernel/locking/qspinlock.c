/*
 * The basic principle of a queue-based spinlock can best be understood
 * by studying a classic queue-based spinlock implementation called the
 * MCS lock. A copy of the original MCS lock paper ("Algorithms for Scalable
 * Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors by Mellor-Crummey and
 * Scott") is available at
 *
 * https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206115
 *
 * This queued spinlock implementation is based on the MCS lock, however to
 * make it fit the 4 bytes we assume spinlock_t to be, and preserve its
 * existing API, we must modify it somehow.
 *
 * In particular; where the traditional MCS lock consists of a tail pointer
 * (8 bytes) and needs the next pointer (another 8 bytes) of its own node to
 * unlock the next pending (next->locked), we compress both these: {tail,
 * next->locked} into a single u32 value.
 *
 * Since a spinlock disables recursion of its own context and there is a limit
 * to the contexts that can nest; namely: task, softirq, hardirq, nmi. As there
 * are at most 4 nesting levels, it can be encoded by a 2-bit number. Now
 * we can encode the tail by combining the 2-bit nesting level with the cpu
 * number. With one byte for the lock value and 3 bytes for the tail, only a
 * 32-bit word is now needed. Even though we only need 1 bit for the lock,
 * we extend it to a full byte to achieve better performance for architectures
 * that support atomic byte write.
 *
 * We also change the first spinner to spin on the lock bit instead of its
 * node; whereby avoiding the need to carry a node from lock to unlock, and
 * preserving existing lock API. This also makes the unlock code simpler and
 * faster.
 *
 * N.B. The current implementation only supports architectures that allow
 *      atomic operations on smaller 8-bit and 16-bit data types.
 *

 * that, we insert two more long words to pad it up to 32 bytes. IOW, only
 * two of them can fit in a cacheline in this case. That is OK as it is rare
 * to have more than 2 levels of slowpath nesting in actual use. We don't
