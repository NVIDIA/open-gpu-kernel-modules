 * Generic wait-for-completion handler;

 * It differs from semaphores in that their default case is the opposite,
 * wait_for_completion default blocks whereas semaphore default non-block. The
 * interface also makes it easy to 'complete' multiple waiting threads,
 * something which isn't entirely natural for semaphores.
 *
 * But more importantly, the primitive documents the usage. Semaphores would
 * typically be used for exclusion which gives rise to priority inversion.
 * Waiting for completion is a typically sync point, but not an exclusion point.
