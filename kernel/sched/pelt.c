 * Let u_i denote the fraction of p_i that the entity was runnable.

 * We then designate the fractions u_i as our co-efficients, yielding the
 * following representation of historical load:
 *   u_0 + u_1*y + u_2*y^2 + u_3*y^3 + ...
 *
 * We choose y based on the with of a reasonably scheduling period, fixing:
 *   y^32 = 0.5

 * This means that the contribution to load ~32ms ago (u_32) will be weighted
 * approximately half as much as the contribution to load within the last ms
 * (u_0).
